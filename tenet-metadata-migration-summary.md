# Tenet Metadata Migration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the migration of tenet files from legacy horizontal rule metadata format to standardized YAML front-matter format.

## Migration Results
- **Total tenet files processed:** 9
- **Files converted to YAML front-matter:** 8
- **Files skipped (already YAML or index):** 1 (00-index.md)
- **Conversion failures:** 0

## Verification
- All regular tenet files now use YAML front-matter format
- The only file without YAML front-matter is the auto-generated index file (`docs/tenets/00-index.md`)
- Metadata values (ID and last_modified date) have been preserved during migration
- All converted files maintain their original content structure

## Technical Implementation
- Created a Ruby script (`tenet_metadata_migration.rb`) to handle the conversion
- The script extracted metadata values from the legacy format and created properly formatted YAML front-matter
- Conversion followed the same pattern used in binding files
- Backups were created before any file modifications

## Next Steps
With all tenet files now using YAML front-matter, we can proceed with:
1. Task T002: Refactoring validation tools to remove legacy format support
2. Task T005: Refactoring indexing tools to remove legacy format support
3. Other tasks that depend on YAML-only format

## Script Preservation
The migration script (`tenet_metadata_migration.rb`) has been preserved in the repository for reference. This is a one-time migration tool that should be considered for archival in a future cleanup task.
