# T035 Plan: Create Documentation for LLM Integration Approaches

## Task Analysis
- Create `docs/LLM_INTEGRATION.md` document outlining strategies for using rewritten tenets and bindings as LLM context
- Include best practices and potential prompt engineering techniques
- Focus on making the guidance practical and actionable for developers

## Current State Assessment
- All tenets and bindings have been rewritten in natural language format
- The natural language approach was specifically designed to work better with LLMs
- Need to document effective strategies for leveraging these documents with LLMs

## Implementation Steps
1. Create the LLM integration document with the following sections:
   - Introduction and purpose
   - How natural language documentation helps LLMs
   - General strategies for using tenets and bindings as context
   - Specific techniques for different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Best practices for prompt engineering
   - Tips for context length management
   - Limitations and considerations

2. Include guidance on:
   - How to select appropriate tenets/bindings for specific coding tasks
   - How to format tenets/bindings for effective inclusion in prompts
   - How to phrase questions/instructions to get the best results
   - How to evaluate and improve LLM outputs

3. Consider potential integration approaches like:
   - Direct inclusion in prompts
   - Retrieval-augmented generation
   - Custom embeddings for semantic search
   - Integration with development tools and workflows

4. Include general prompt engineering principles that work well with the natural language format

5. Update TODO.md to mark task as complete

6. Commit changes

## Success Criteria
- The document provides clear, practical guidance on using the rewritten documents with LLMs
- Best practices and prompt engineering techniques are included
- The document is well-structured and easy to follow
- Changes are properly committed
- Task is marked as complete in TODO.md
