# Integrating Tenets and Bindings with Large Language Models

This guide outlines strategies for effectively using Leyline's tenets and bindings as context for Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance code quality, maintain consistency with development standards, and automate aspects of code review.

## Introduction

Leyline's tenets and bindings have been rewritten with a "natural language first" approach specifically designed to:

1. **Make principles more accessible to humans** of different technical backgrounds
2. **Serve as effective context for Large Language Models (LLMs)**
3. **Focus on principles and patterns** rather than implementation details

This document explains how to leverage these documents with LLMs to improve your development workflows, code quality, and adherence to principles.

## Why Natural Language Documentation Works Better with LLMs

Traditional technical documentation often focuses on low-level implementation details using terse, technical language. This presents challenges for LLMs for several reasons:

1. **Context Limitations**: LLMs have finite context windows, so documentation that's concise yet comprehensive has advantages
2. **Principle Understanding**: LLMs understand principles better than highly technical specifics
3. **Reasoning Capabilities**: LLMs reason more effectively with natural language explanations than with prescriptive rules

Our natural language approach addresses these limitations by:

- **Using conversational language** that models can interpret more accurately
- **Including relatable analogies** that help models grasp abstract concepts
- **Focusing on the "why"** behind rules, which models can apply to novel situations
- **Providing explicit connections** between related concepts, which models can leverage for reasoning

## General Strategies for Using Tenets and Bindings as LLM Context

### 1. Selective Context Inclusion

Rather than including all tenets and bindings in every prompt, select the most relevant ones for your specific task:

- **For architectural decisions**: Include high-level tenets like simplicity, modularity, and maintainability
- **For language-specific implementation**: Include relevant bindings (e.g., ts-no-any for TypeScript projects)
- **For specific concerns**: Include targeted tenets/bindings (e.g., automation for CI/CD tasks)

### 2. Context Ordering

The order of context matters for LLMs. Structure your prompts for maximum effectiveness:

1. Begin with the most relevant tenet(s) to establish core principles
2. Follow with specific bindings that implement those principles
3. Place the most directly relevant content earlier in the prompt

### 3. Explicit References

When asking the LLM to apply principles or rules, explicitly reference the relevant documents:

```
Apply the principles from the "Simplicity Above All" tenet and the "Immutable by Default" binding to refactor this code...
```

### 4. Staged Processing

For complex tasks, use a multi-stage approach:

1. First prompt: Ask the LLM to analyze which tenets/bindings are relevant to the task
2. Second prompt: Include only those relevant documents as context and perform the task

## Prompt Engineering Techniques

### Template for Code Review

```
I'll provide you with code that needs review according to our development principles.
First, I'll share relevant tenets and bindings, then the code to review.

TENET: [Paste tenet content here]

BINDING: [Paste binding content here]

CODE TO REVIEW:
```code
[Your code here]
```

Please review this code based on the provided tenets and bindings.
For each issue:
1. Identify the specific principle or rule that's violated
2. Explain why it's problematic
3. Suggest a concrete improvement
```

### Template for Code Generation

```
I need you to help me implement [feature/component description].
Our codebase follows these principles and rules:

TENET: [Paste tenet content here]

BINDING: [Paste binding content here]

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
- [Any project-specific context or constraints]

Please generate code that implements this feature while following our principles.
Explain your design choices and how they align with the provided tenets and bindings.
```

### Template for Refactoring

```
I have code that needs refactoring to better align with our development principles.

TENET: [Paste tenet content here]

BINDING: [Paste binding content here]

CURRENT CODE:
```code
[Your code here]
```

Please refactor this code to better follow our principles. Explain:
1. What aspects of the current code violate our principles
2. How your refactoring addresses these issues
3. Any trade-offs you considered
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Provide Sufficient Context

Always include:
- The relevant tenets and bindings
- Project-specific context that might override general principles
- Constraints or requirements that must be met

### 2. Be Specific in Your Requests

Clearly state what you want the LLM to do:
- "Evaluate if this code follows the immutability binding"
- "Suggest changes to make this code more modular"
- "Explain how this code could be simplified following our simplicity tenet"

### 3. Use Multi-turn Conversations

Build context over multiple interactions:
1. Start with general guidance and principles
2. Refine based on the LLM's responses
3. Ask for specific applications of principles to your code

### 4. Address Limitations

Be aware of LLM limitations:
- Models may not understand complex, project-specific abstractions without explanation
- Programming languages evolve, and models may not be aware of the latest features
- Models may need guidance on prioritizing when different principles conflict

## Managing Context Length

Most LLMs have context length limitations. To manage this:

1. **Summarize tenets and bindings** when appropriate, focusing on the core principles
2. **Use selective inclusion** rather than providing all documentation
3. **Create shortened versions** of the most frequently used tenets and bindings
4. **Split complex tasks** into smaller sub-tasks with focused context

### Example: Shortened Version of a Tenet

```
TENET (Simplicity): Prefer the simplest design that solves the problem. 
Complexity causes defects and cognitive overload. Use YAGNI (You Aren't 
Gonna Need It) rigorously, minimize moving parts, and value readability 
over cleverness. Warning signs include over-engineering, premature 
abstraction, and designing for imagined future requirements.
```

## Integration Approaches

### 1. Direct Inclusion in Prompts

The simplest approach is to directly copy relevant tenets and bindings into your prompts. This works well for:
- One-off coding tasks
- Code reviews of specific files or functions
- Explaining principles to team members

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

For more sophisticated applications, implement a RAG system:
1. Convert all tenets and bindings to embeddings
2. Store in a vector database
3. When a query comes in, find the most relevant documents
4. Include only those documents in the context

### 3. Custom Agents and Tools

Build custom tools that can:
- Automatically retrieve relevant tenets and bindings based on the task
- Enforce compliance with key principles
- Guide developers through the application of principles

### 4. IDE Integration

Consider integrating with development environments:
- VS Code extensions that can insert relevant tenets/bindings
- Git hooks that check for compliance with principles
- CI/CD integrations that enforce bindings

## Provider-Specific Guidance

### OpenAI (GPT-4, etc.)

- **Context Window**: Efficiently use the 8K-32K token context window
- **Function Calling**: Define functions that retrieve relevant tenets/bindings
- **System Instructions**: Use system instructions to establish consistent application of principles

### Anthropic (Claude)

- **Longer Context**: Take advantage of Claude's larger context window for more comprehensive inclusion
- **Xml Tags**: Structure your prompts with XML tags for clear organization
- **Conversational Style**: Claude works well with the conversational style of the rewritten documents

### Open Source Models

- **More Explicit Guidance**: May need more explicit instructions to apply principles correctly
- **Repetition**: Consider restating key principles in different ways for reinforcement
- **Concrete Examples**: Include more examples of principles in action

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Model Knowledge Cutoffs**: LLMs may not be aware of the latest technological developments
2. **Inconsistent Application**: Models may apply principles inconsistently without careful prompting
3. **Over-reliance**: Use LLMs as assistants rather than replacements for human judgment
4. **Context Collapse**: Very large contexts may cause models to lose focus on specific principles
5. **Prioritization**: Models may struggle to prioritize when principles conflict

## Future Directions

As LLM technology evolves, consider:

1. **Fine-tuning models** specifically on your tenets and bindings
2. **Creating embeddings** that better represent your principles
3. **Building custom agents** that specialize in applying your specific principles
4. **Automating compliance checks** based on LLM evaluation
