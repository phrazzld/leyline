# Binding: GitHub Actions Deprecation Prevention Quality Gates

Implement automated validation checkpoints that prevent CI failures from deprecated GitHub Actions by detecting deprecated actions early and providing clear upgrade guidance. This creates systematic barriers that catch deprecation issues before they impact the development pipeline.

## Rationale

This binding implements our automated-quality-gates principle by creating specific systems that prevent CI failures from GitHub Actions deprecations. As GitHub continuously evolves and deprecates older action versions, manual tracking becomes error-prone and reactive. Automated quality gates provide proactive protection against workflow failures.

GitHub Actions deprecations often cause sudden CI failures that can block critical releases. These failures are preventable through systematic validation that catches deprecations early, provides clear upgrade guidance, and ensures teams stay current with supported action versions.

## Rule Definition

**MUST** implement GitHub Actions validation at multiple pipeline stages:
- Pre-commit hooks for immediate developer feedback
- Pull request validation to prevent deprecated actions from entering main branch
- Scheduled scanning to catch new deprecations
- Integration with existing CI validation pipelines

**MUST** validate against a comprehensive deprecation database that includes:
- Deprecated action names and versions
- Deprecation dates and reasons
- Recommended upgrade paths with specific guidance
- Severity levels (high/medium/low) for prioritization

**MUST** provide fast feedback with specific, actionable upgrade guidance including:
- Exact replacement action and version
- Configuration changes required for upgrade
- Breaking changes and migration considerations

**SHOULD** maintain an updateable deprecation database that can be refreshed from external sources.

**SHOULD** include emergency override mechanisms for critical fixes with audit trails.

## Implementation Architecture

**Core Components:**
- Validation Tool (`tools/validate_github_actions.rb`)
- Deprecation Database (`tools/github-actions-deprecations.yml`)
- CI Integration (`.github/workflows/validate-actions.yml`)
- Pre-commit Hook Integration

**Deprecation Database Structure:**
```yaml
# tools/github-actions-deprecations.yml
actions/checkout@v3:
  deprecated_since: '2023-12-01'
  reason: 'Superseded by v4 with Node.js 20 support'
  upgrade_to: 'actions/checkout@v4'
  severity: 'low'
```

**CI Workflow Integration:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/validate-actions.yml
name: Validate GitHub Actions
on:
  push:
    paths: ['.github/workflows/**']
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'

jobs:
  validate-actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
      - run: ruby tools/validate_github_actions.rb --verbose
```

## Quality Gate Flow

**1. Pre-commit Validation (Immediate Feedback)**
```bash
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "\.github/workflows/"; then
  ruby tools/validate_github_actions.rb --verbose
fi
```

**2. Pull Request Validation:** Automated workflow triggers on workflow changes
**3. Scheduled Monitoring:** Weekly scans to catch new deprecations
**4. Emergency Override:** Skip validation with `[emergency-deploy]` in commit message

## Severity Levels

**High Severity:** Will cause CI failures - block PRs, fix within 1 week
**Medium Severity:** Missing features/patches - warning in PRs, fix within 1 month
**Low Severity:** Superseded but functional - informational notice, fix within 3 months

## Error Message Examples

```
ðŸš¨ DEPRECATED ACTION (HIGH severity)
  File: .github/workflows/ci.yml
  Action: actions/checkout@v1
  Reason: Uses deprecated Node.js 12

ðŸ”§ UPGRADE:
  Replace with: actions/checkout@v4
  - uses: actions/checkout@v1
  + uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

## Maintenance Strategy

**Database Updates:** Manual updates via `ruby tools/validate_github_actions.rb --update`
**Performance Monitoring:** Track validation execution time and cache efficiency
**False Positive Management:** Whitelist mechanism for internal/custom actions

## Integration Examples

**Common Deprecations Caught:**
- `actions/setup-node@v1` â†’ `actions/setup-node@v4`
- `actions/cache@v2` â†’ `actions/cache@v4`
- `actions/checkout@v2` â†’ `actions/checkout@v4`

## Key Metrics

- **Deprecation Detection Rate:** Percentage caught before CI failures
- **Mean Time to Upgrade:** Detection to resolution time
- **False Positive Rate:** Incorrect deprecation warnings
