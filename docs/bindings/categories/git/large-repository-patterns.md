# Binding: Implement Large Repository Patterns for Scale

Apply proven patterns for managing Git repositories that scale to millions of files, hundreds of gigabytes, and thousands of contributors. Use techniques like sparse checkouts, partial clones, and Git LFS to maintain performance while supporting massive codebases.

## Rationale

This binding implements our distributed Git workflows tenet by addressing scale challenges. As repositories grow, traditional Git workflows break down. Large repositories create friction across developers, CI jobs, and deployments.

Large repository patterns apply distributed systems principles: partition data intelligently, cache aggressively, transfer only what's needed. These patterns maintain the developer experience of small repositories while handling massive codebases.

## Rule Definition

**Required Patterns:**
- **Partial Clone**: Clone only needed history and objects
- **Sparse Checkout**: Work with repository subsets
- **Git LFS**: Move large files to specialized storage
- **Shallow History**: Limit history depth for performance
- **Caching**: Implement aggressive caching strategies

**Scale Thresholds:**
- Repository > 1GB → Git LFS
- Clone time > 2min → Partial clone
- Files > 50,000 → Sparse checkout
- Binaries > 10MB → Mandate LFS

**Performance Targets:**
- Initial clone: < 2min, Fetch: < 10s, Checkout: < 30s, CI: < 1min

## Practical Implementation

1. **Configure Partial Clone**:
   ```bash
   # Enable partial clone support
   git config uploadpack.allowFilter true
   git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/company/large-repo
   git config core.missingBlobBatchSize 100
   ```

2. **Implement Sparse Checkout**:
   ```bash
   # Enable sparse checkout
   git sparse-checkout init --cone
   git sparse-checkout set src/frontend shared/types

   # Team-specific patterns
   echo "/src/frontend/
   /shared/types/
   /package.json" > .git/info/sparse-checkout
   git sparse-checkout reapply
   ```

3. **Migrate Large Files to Git LFS**:
   ```bash
   # Initialize and configure Git LFS
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.psd" "*.zip" "*.mp4" "assets/images/**"
   git lfs migrate import --include="*.psd,*.zip" --everything
   git config lfs.concurrenttransfers 10
   ```

4. **Optimize CI/CD**:
   ```yaml
   # GitHub Actions for large repos
   jobs:
     build:
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
           with:
             filter: blob:none
             fetch-depth: 1
             sparse-checkout: src/backend tests/backend
         - name: Cache Git Objects
           uses: actions/cache@v3
           with:
             path: .git/objects
             key: git-objects-${{ github.sha }}
   ```

5. **Repository Maintenance**:
   ```bash
   # Optimize repository performance
   git gc --aggressive --prune=now
   git repack -a -d --write-bitmap-index

   # Find largest objects
   git rev-list --objects --all | git cat-file --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize) %(rest)' | sort -k3 -n -r | head -20
   ```

## Examples

```bash
# ❌ BAD: Traditional clone
git clone https://github.com/company/monorepo  # 30 minutes, 18GB

# ✅ GOOD: Optimized patterns
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/company/monorepo  # 45 seconds
git sparse-checkout set src/my-service  # Only needed files
```

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Full CI checkout
- uses: actions/checkout@v3  # Downloads 20GB, takes 15 minutes

# ✅ GOOD: Optimized CI
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
  with:
    filter: blob:none
    sparse-checkout: src/service-a tests/service-a  # 200MB, 30 seconds
```

```bash
# ❌ BAD: Large files in Git (500MB files → 10GB+ repo)
# ✅ GOOD: Git LFS (.gitattributes)
*.mp4 filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text  # 500MB repo + 2.5GB LFS
```
