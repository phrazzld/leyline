# Binding: Implement Automated Git Rollback Procedures

Design and implement automated rollback mechanisms that can quickly restore system state when problems occur. Create multiple rollback strategies—from simple reverts to complex state restoration—that work reliably under pressure without manual intervention.

## Rationale

This binding implements our Git reliability engineering tenet by acknowledging that failures are inevitable and preparing systematic responses. In distributed systems, we design for failure by implementing circuit breakers, fallbacks, and automated recovery. Git rollback procedures serve the same purpose for version control: when things go wrong, we need fast, reliable ways to restore good state without depending on human memory or availability.

Traditional rollback approaches often rely on manual Git commands executed under pressure: "Quick, someone git revert that commit!" This approach fails at scale because it requires the right person with the right permissions to execute the right commands while the system is degraded. By automating rollback procedures and integrating them with monitoring, we transform crisis response from a panic-driven scramble into a calm, measured process.

Think of automated rollback as your version control airbag—it deploys automatically when crashes are detected, protecting the system from further damage. Just as modern deployment systems can automatically roll back failed deployments, Git workflows need automated procedures for reverting problematic changes, restoring from known-good states, and recovering from corruption. These procedures must be tested regularly, documented thoroughly, and executable by anyone (or no one, in fully automated cases).

## Rule Definition

Automated rollback procedures must provide multiple strategies for different failure scenarios:

- **Commit-Level Rollback**: Automated reversion of specific commits that introduce problems, with dependency analysis.

- **Time-Based Rollback**: Ability to restore repository state to any point in time, useful for systemic issues.

- **Branch-Level Rollback**: Automated restoration of entire branches to previous states, including force-push scenarios.

- **Binary Search Rollback**: Automated git bisect procedures to identify and revert problematic changes.

- **State Verification**: Automated testing to ensure rollback achieved desired state without introducing new issues.

**Rollback Requirements**:
- One-click or fully automated rollback triggers
- Multiple rollback strategies for different scenarios
- Automated impact analysis before rollback
- Rollback verification and testing
- Audit trail of all rollback operations
- Integration with monitoring and alerting

**Rollback Strategies**:
- Simple revert: Reverse specific commits
- Range revert: Reverse series of commits
- Reset rollback: Force branch to previous state
- Cherry-pick rollback: Selective change removal
- Snapshot restore: Full repository state restoration

## Practical Implementation

1. **Create Automated Revert Pipelines**: Implement workflow-triggered rollback with these core components:
   - **Impact Analysis**: Check for dependent commits and subsequent changes to affected files
   - **Strategy Selection**: Choose between simple revert, branch reset, or automated bisect
   - **Verification**: Run full test suite to ensure rollback doesn't introduce new issues
   - **Documentation**: Auto-generate rollback PR with context and verification results

2. **Implement Time-Based Recovery**: Enable point-in-time repository restoration:
   ```python
   # Core time-based rollback functionality
   def rollback_to_time(target_time, branch='main'):
       """Rollback repository to state at specific time."""
       # Find commit that was HEAD at target time
       target_commit = find_commit_at_time(target_time)

       # Create rollback branch for safety
       rollback_branch = f"rollback-{branch}-{int(target_time.timestamp())}"
       create_branch(rollback_branch, target_commit)

       # Verify state and update branch if verification passes
       if verify_repository_state(rollback_branch):
           update_branch(branch, target_commit)
           return success_result(target_commit, rollback_branch)
   ```

3. **Create Binary Search Rollback**: Automate problematic commit identification using `git bisect run` with automated test scripts that verify both functionality and performance requirements.

4. **Integrate with Monitoring**: Connect production metrics to rollback triggers:
   - Monitor error rates and latency thresholds
   - Automatically trigger rollback when SLOs are violated
   - Generate incident reports with rollback rationale

5. **Test Rollback Procedures**: Run weekly rollback drills with synthetic failure scenarios to ensure procedures work under pressure.

## Example

```bash
# ❌ BAD: Manual panic-driven rollback
# "Production is down! Someone revert that last commit!"
# Manual SSH, guessing commits, merge conflicts, calling team members

# ✅ GOOD: Automated rollback procedure
# Alert: Error rate spike detected after deployment abc123
# Automated response:
# 1. Rollback triggered by monitoring (90 seconds total)
# 2. Impact analysis and revert PR auto-created
# 3. Tests pass, deployment rolled back
# 4. Incident report generated
# Zero human intervention required
```

- [git-monitoring-metrics.md](git-monitoring-metrics.md): Monitoring metrics trigger automated rollbacks based on SLO violations. Error rates, latency spikes, and other indicators can initiate rollback procedures without human intervention.

- [git-backup-strategy.md](git-backup-strategy.md): Backup strategies provide the foundation for rollback capabilities. Point-in-time backups enable restoration to any previous state when simple reverts aren't sufficient.

- [feature-flag-driven-development.md](feature-flag-driven-development.md): Feature flags provide instant rollback without Git operations. Combining feature flags with Git rollback gives multiple layers of recovery options.

- [atomic-commits.md](atomic-commits.md): Atomic commits make rollbacks predictable and safe. When each commit is self-contained, reverting doesn't create cascading failures or break dependencies.

- [ci-cd-pipeline-standards.md](../../core/ci-cd-pipeline-standards.md): Rollback procedures must integrate with CI/CD pipelines to ensure reverted code is properly built, tested, and deployed through standard processes.
