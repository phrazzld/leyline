# Binding: Automate Distributed Conflict Resolution

Design conflict resolution strategies that scale across distributed teams without requiring synchronous coordination. Use ownership boundaries, automated merge strategies, and clear escalation paths to handle conflicts predictably and efficiently.

## Rationale

This binding implements our distributed Git workflows tenet by acknowledging that conflicts are not failures but natural outcomes of distributed collaboration. In distributed systems, we handle concurrent updates through well-defined consistency models and conflict resolution strategies. Git workflows need the same systematic approach to handle the inevitable conflicts that arise when distributed teams work on shared codebases.

Traditional conflict resolution often relies on synchronous communication: "Let me slack the other developer to figure out this merge conflict." This approach breaks down across time zones and scales poorly with team size. By establishing automated conflict resolution strategies and clear ownership boundaries, we transform conflict resolution from an exceptional interruption into a routine, handled process.

Think of this like eventual consistency in distributed databases. Just as databases use techniques like last-write-wins, vector clocks, or CRDTs to resolve conflicts automatically, Git workflows can use ownership rules, semantic merge strategies, and automated testing to resolve many conflicts without human intervention. When manual resolution is needed, clear escalation paths and async-friendly processes ensure resolution doesn't block on availability.

## Rule Definition

Distributed conflict resolution must follow these principles:

- **Ownership-Based Resolution**: Use CODEOWNERS and clear module boundaries to automatically determine who resolves conflicts in specific areas.

- **Semantic Merge Strategies**: Implement language-aware merge tools that understand code structure, not just text differences.

- **Automated Conflict Detection**: Detect potential conflicts before they occur through continuous integration of feature branches.

- **Asynchronous Resolution Workflows**: Design resolution processes that work across time zones without requiring real-time coordination.

- **Conflict Metrics and Learning**: Track conflict patterns to identify hotspots and improve code organization.

**Key Requirements**:
- CODEOWNERS files defining clear ownership boundaries
- Automated merge strategies for common patterns
- Pre-merge conflict detection in CI
- Documented escalation procedures
- Conflict tracking and analysis
- Async-first communication protocols

**Resolution Strategies**:
- Ownership-based: Owner of modified code decides
- Temporal: Last meaningful change wins
- Semantic: Based on code understanding
- Policy-based: Predetermined rules for common cases

## Practical Implementation

1. **Establish Clear Ownership Boundaries**: Use CODEOWNERS to define who owns what, enabling automatic assignment of conflict resolution:
   ```gitignore
   # CODEOWNERS - Clear ownership for distributed teams
   # Global owners
   * @platform-team

   # Feature area owners
   /src/payments/ @payments-team
   /src/auth/ @security-team @auth-team
   /src/frontend/components/ @ui-team

   # Overlap areas with multiple owners
   /src/api/ @backend-team @api-team
   ```

2. **Implement Semantic Merge Tools**: Use language-aware merge strategies that understand code structure:
   ```bash
   # Git configuration for semantic merging
   git config merge.tool semantic-merge
   git config mergetool.semantic-merge.cmd 'semantic-merge-tool $BASE $LOCAL $REMOTE $MERGED'

   # Language-specific merge strategies
   *.json merge=json-merge
   *.yaml merge=yaml-merge
   package-lock.json merge=npm-merge
   ```

3. **Create Pre-Merge Conflict Detection**: Detect conflicts early through continuous integration:
   ```yaml
   # CI workflow for conflict detection
   name: Conflict Detection
   on:
     pull_request:
       types: [opened, synchronize]

   jobs:
     detect-conflicts:
       steps:
         - name: Test merge with main
           run: |
             git fetch origin main
             git merge-tree $(git merge-base HEAD origin/main) HEAD origin/main > merge-tree.txt
             if grep -q "<<<<<<" merge-tree.txt; then
               echo "::warning::Potential conflicts detected with main branch"
               # Post comment with conflict details
             fi
   ```

4. **Design Async Resolution Workflows**: Create processes that don't require synchronous communication:
   ```typescript
   // Automated conflict resolution assignment
   async function assignConflictResolution(conflict: MergeConflict) {
     const owners = await getCodeOwners(conflict.files);
     const resolver = selectResolver(owners, conflict.teams);

     await createIssue({
       title: `Resolve merge conflict in ${conflict.branch}`,
       assignee: resolver,
       body: conflictTemplate(conflict),
       labels: ['merge-conflict', conflict.severity],
       sla: conflict.severity === 'blocking' ? '4h' : '24h'
     });

     // Notify through async channels
     await notifySlack(resolver, conflict);
     await updateStatusPage(conflict);
   }
   ```

5. **Track and Learn from Conflicts**: Monitor conflict patterns to improve code organization:
   ```sql
   -- Conflict analytics query
   SELECT
     file_path,
     COUNT(*) as conflict_count,
     AVG(resolution_time) as avg_resolution_time,
     GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT team) as teams_involved
   FROM merge_conflicts
   WHERE created_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
   GROUP BY file_path
   HAVING conflict_count > 3
   ORDER BY conflict_count DESC;
   -- Identifies conflict hotspots for refactoring
   ```

## Examples

```bash
# ❌ BAD: Manual conflict resolution requiring synchronization
git merge feature-branch
# CONFLICT in src/core/engine.ts
# "Hey @teammate, can we jump on a call to resolve this?"
# Blocked waiting for response across time zones

# ✅ GOOD: Automated ownership-based resolution
git merge feature-branch
# CONFLICT in src/payments/checkout.ts
# Automatically assigned to @payments-team based on CODEOWNERS
# Created issue #1234 with conflict details and resolution SLA
# Resolver can work async with full context
```

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Ad-hoc conflict handling
on-conflict:
  - message developers
  - figure out who should resolve
  - wait for availability
  - resolve together
  - hope we remember next time

# ✅ GOOD: Systematic conflict workflow
on-conflict:
  - detect: Automated by merge-queue
  - assign: Based on CODEOWNERS + availability
  - notify: Async channels with context
  - resolve: Using documented strategies
  - track: Metrics for improvement
  - prevent: Refactor hotspots
```

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Conflict-prone code organization
// shared/constants.ts - Everyone modifies this
export const CONFIG = {
  feature1: {...},  // Team A
  feature2: {...},  // Team B
  feature3: {...},  // Team C
};
// Constant conflicts as teams add features

// ✅ GOOD: Conflict-resistant modular organization
// feature1/constants.ts - Team A owns
export const FEATURE1_CONFIG = {...};

// feature2/constants.ts - Team B owns
export const FEATURE2_CONFIG = {...};

// shared/config-registry.ts - Automated aggregation
export const CONFIG = {
  ...FEATURE1_CONFIG,
  ...FEATURE2_CONFIG,
  ...FEATURE3_CONFIG,
};
// Teams work independently, conflicts rare
```
