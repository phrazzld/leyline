# Binding: Design Workflows for Globally Distributed Teams

Create Git workflows that embrace the reality of teams distributed across time zones, cultures, and continents. Design for asynchronous collaboration as the default, with clear handoff procedures, comprehensive documentation, and automation that bridges temporal gaps.

## Rationale

This binding implements our distributed Git workflows tenet by acknowledging that the sun never sets on modern software teams. Traditional workflows designed for co-located teams break down when your teammate's morning is your evening, and their code review might come while you're asleep. Instead of fighting this reality, we must design workflows that turn time zone distribution into a superpower: 24-hour development cycles where work progresses continuously around the globe.

Distributed team workflows require the same design principles as distributed systems: loose coupling, clear interfaces, and asynchronous communication. Just as microservices communicate through well-defined APIs rather than shared memory, distributed teams must communicate through well-documented pull requests rather than hallway conversations. The goal is to enable any team member to pick up where another left off without needing synchronous communication.

Think of distributed workflows like a relay race where runners might never meet—the baton pass happens through clear documentation, comprehensive tests, and predictable processes. When a developer in Berlin completes their day, a developer in San Francisco should be able to continue the work seamlessly. This requires more than just good Git practices; it demands a fundamental rethinking of how teams collaborate across space and time.

## Rule Definition

Distributed team workflows must optimize for asynchronous collaboration:

- **Time Zone Awareness**: Design processes that work across 24-hour cycles without requiring overlapping work hours.

- **Context-Rich Communication**: Every commit, PR, and decision must include enough context for someone to understand it independently.

- **Automated Handoffs**: Use automation to bridge time gaps, ensuring work progresses without human intervention.

- **Cultural Inclusivity**: Design workflows that respect different working styles, languages, and cultural norms.

- **Predictable Processes**: Establish clear conventions that work regardless of who's online at any given moment.

**Core Principles**:
- Asynchronous by default, synchronous by exception
- Documentation as primary communication
- Automation bridges time zone gaps
- Clear ownership and escalation paths
- Respect for work-life boundaries
- Inclusive communication practices

**Workflow Components**:
- PR templates with comprehensive context
- Automated status updates across time zones
- Clear handoff procedures
- Time zone-aware scheduling
- Async code review processes
- Self-service documentation

## Practical Implementation

1. **Create Time Zone-Aware Automation**: Build workflows that respect global distribution:
   - **Intelligent Reviewer Assignment**: Automatically assign reviews to team members in active working hours
   - **Handoff Documentation**: Generate comprehensive handoff messages with work status, blockers, and next steps
   - **Regional Scheduling**: Schedule workflows to trigger at the start of each major timezone's workday

2. **Implement Async-First PR Process**: Design pull requests for comprehensive async review:
   ```yaml
   # PR Template for Distributed Teams

   ## Async Review Guidelines
   **Expected review time**: ~2 hours
   **Time zones covered**: US-West → Europe → Asia

   ## Handoff Notes
   If I'm offline when you review, here's additional context:
   Questions? Please add comments and I'll address them in my next working hours.
   ```

3. **Create Global Team Dashboards**: Provide visibility across all time zones showing team member status, current work, and availability windows for optimal collaboration timing.

4. **Establish Async Communication Standards**: Include timezone context in commit messages, specify availability in PR comments, and provide clear handoff instructions for offline periods.

5. **Automate Cross-Time Zone Workflows**: Bridge temporal gaps with automation that assigns reviewers based on timezone availability, generates daily handoff reports, and updates PR status across regions.

## Example

```bash
# ❌ BAD: Synchronous-dependent workflow
# "Let's discuss this in the morning standup"
# "Blocked waiting for John to come online"
# European team blocked on US decisions

# ✅ GOOD: Async-first workflow
# Every PR includes comprehensive context
# Decisions documented in PR/commit messages
# Clear handoff between time zones
# Work progresses 24/7 without blocking
# "Follow the sun" development model
```
