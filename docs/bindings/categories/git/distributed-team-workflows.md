# Binding: Design Workflows for Globally Distributed Teams

Create Git workflows that embrace the reality of teams distributed across time zones, cultures, and continents. Design for asynchronous collaboration as the default, with clear handoff procedures, comprehensive documentation, and automation that bridges temporal gaps.

## Rationale

This binding implements our distributed Git workflows tenet by acknowledging that the sun never sets on modern software teams. Traditional workflows designed for co-located teams break down when your teammate's morning is your evening, and their code review might come while you're asleep. Instead of fighting this reality, we must design workflows that turn time zone distribution into a superpower: 24-hour development cycles where work progresses continuously around the globe.

Distributed team workflows require the same design principles as distributed systems: loose coupling, clear interfaces, and asynchronous communication. Just as microservices communicate through well-defined APIs rather than shared memory, distributed teams must communicate through well-documented pull requests rather than hallway conversations. The goal is to enable any team member to pick up where another left off without needing synchronous communication.

Think of distributed workflows like a relay race where runners might never meet—the baton pass happens through clear documentation, comprehensive tests, and predictable processes. When a developer in Berlin completes their day, a developer in San Francisco should be able to continue the work seamlessly. This requires more than just good Git practices; it demands a fundamental rethinking of how teams collaborate across space and time.

## Rule Definition

Distributed team workflows must optimize for asynchronous collaboration:

- **Time Zone Awareness**: Design processes that work across 24-hour cycles without requiring overlapping work hours.

- **Context-Rich Communication**: Every commit, PR, and decision must include enough context for someone to understand it independently.

- **Automated Handoffs**: Use automation to bridge time gaps, ensuring work progresses without human intervention.

- **Cultural Inclusivity**: Design workflows that respect different working styles, languages, and cultural norms.

- **Predictable Processes**: Establish clear conventions that work regardless of who's online at any given moment.

**Core Principles**:
- Asynchronous by default, synchronous by exception
- Documentation as primary communication
- Automation bridges time zone gaps
- Clear ownership and escalation paths
- Respect for work-life boundaries
- Inclusive communication practices

**Workflow Components**:
- PR templates with comprehensive context
- Automated status updates across time zones
- Clear handoff procedures
- Time zone-aware scheduling
- Async code review processes
- Self-service documentation

## Practical Implementation

1. **Create Time Zone-Aware Automation**: Build workflows that respect global distribution:
   ```python
   # Time zone aware workflow automation
   from datetime import datetime, timezone
   import pytz
   from typing import Dict, List, Optional

   class DistributedTeamWorkflow:
       def __init__(self):
           self.team_zones = {
               'us-west': pytz.timezone('America/Los_Angeles'),
               'us-east': pytz.timezone('America/New_York'),
               'europe': pytz.timezone('Europe/Berlin'),
               'asia': pytz.timezone('Asia/Tokyo'),
           }

       def find_next_available_reviewer(self, pr_created_time: datetime) -> str:
           """Find reviewer in the next working time zone."""
           current_hour_by_zone = {}

           for region, tz in self.team_zones.items():
               local_time = pr_created_time.astimezone(tz)
               current_hour_by_zone[region] = local_time.hour

           # Find regions in working hours (9 AM - 5 PM)
           available_regions = [
               region for region, hour in current_hour_by_zone.items()
               if 9 <= hour <= 17
           ]

           if not available_regions:
               # Find region about to start work
               upcoming_regions = sorted(
                   current_hour_by_zone.items(),
                   key=lambda x: (x[1] - 9) % 24
               )
               return upcoming_regions[0][0]

           return available_regions[0]

       def create_handoff_message(self, from_region: str, to_region: str,
                                 work_summary: Dict) -> str:
           """Generate comprehensive handoff documentation."""
           return f"""
   ## Handoff from {from_region} to {to_region}

   **Handoff Time**: {datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()}

   ### Work Completed
   {work_summary.get('completed', 'None')}

   ### Work In Progress
   {work_summary.get('in_progress', 'None')}

   ### Blockers
   {work_summary.get('blockers', 'None')}

   ### Next Steps
   {work_summary.get('next_steps', 'None')}

   ### Context and Decisions
   {work_summary.get('context', 'None')}

   ### Relevant Links
   - PR: {work_summary.get('pr_link', 'N/A')}
   - Design Doc: {work_summary.get('design_doc', 'N/A')}
   - Discussion Thread: {work_summary.get('discussion', 'N/A')}
   """
   ```

2. **Implement Async-First PR Process**: Design pull requests for async review:
   ```yaml
   # .github/pull_request_template.md

   ## Async Review Guidelines

   **Expected review time**: ~2 hours
   **Complexity**: Low/Medium/High
   **Time zones covered**: US-West → Europe → Asia

   ## Handoff Notes
   <!-- For reviewer in next time zone -->
   If I'm offline when you review, here's additional context:
   -
   -

   Questions? Please add comments and I'll address them in my next working hours.
   ```

3. **Create Global Team Dashboards**: Visibility across all time zones:
   ```typescript
   // Global team status dashboard
   interface TeamMember {
     name: string;
     timezone: string;
     currentStatus: 'working' | 'offline' | 'away';
     currentWork?: string;
     nextOnline?: Date;
   }

   class GlobalTeamDashboard {
     getTeamStatus(): Map<string, TeamMember[]> {
       const now = new Date();
       const teamByStatus = new Map<string, TeamMember[]>();

       for (const member of this.teamMembers) {
         const localTime = this.getLocalTime(now, member.timezone);
         const hour = localTime.getHours();

         // Determine status based on local time
         let status: string;
         if (hour >= 9 && hour < 17 && this.isWorkday(localTime)) {
           status = 'working';
         } else if (hour >= 17 && hour < 22) {
           status = 'evening';
         } else {
           status = 'offline';
         }

         if (!teamByStatus.has(status)) {
           teamByStatus.set(status, []);
         }
         teamByStatus.get(status)!.push(member);
       }

       return teamByStatus;
     }

     suggestReviewer(prTimezone: string): TeamMember | null {
       // Find reviewer in overlapping or next time zone
       const status = this.getTeamStatus();
       const working = status.get('working') || [];

       // Prefer same timezone
       const sameZone = working.filter(m => m.timezone === prTimezone);
       if (sameZone.length > 0) {
         return this.leastBusy(sameZone);
       }

       // Then overlapping timezones
       const overlapping = working.filter(m =>
         this.hasOverlap(m.timezone, prTimezone)
       );
       if (overlapping.length > 0) {
         return this.leastBusy(overlapping);
       }

       // Finally, next timezone to come online
       return this.nextAvailable(prTimezone);
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Establish Async Communication Standards**: Clear, context-rich communication:
   ```markdown
   # Distributed Team Communication Standards

   ## Commit Messages
   Include timezone context when relevant:
   ```
   feat(auth): Add OAuth2 integration

   - Implemented GitHub OAuth provider
   - Added token refresh logic
   - Configured for EU data residency requirements

   Testing: Manual testing with EU test accounts completed
   Handoff: US team please verify with US accounts

   Part of: PROJECT-123
   Design: https://docs.company.com/oauth-design
   ```

   ## PR Comments
   Always include:
   - Your current timezone/location
   - When you'll be back online
   - How to proceed without you

   Example:
   ```
   Great question! The rate limiting is set to 100/hour to comply with
   GDPR requirements for EU users.

   I'm in Berlin (CET) and heading offline at 6 PM (in 2 hours).
   If you need changes before I'm back:
   - The config is in `src/config/rate-limits.ts`
   - Tests are in `tests/rate-limiting.test.ts`
   - @asia-team-lead can approve EU compliance changes

   I'll check messages first thing tomorrow (9 AM CET / 4 PM JST).
   ```
   ```

5. **Automate Cross-Time Zone Workflows**: Bridge temporal gaps with automation:
   ```yaml
   # GitHub Actions workflow for distributed teams
   name: Distributed Team Workflow

   on:
     pull_request:
       types: [opened, ready_for_review]
     schedule:
       # Run at the start of each major timezone's workday
       - cron: '0 1 * * *'   # 9 AM Beijing
       - cron: '0 8 * * *'   # 9 AM Berlin
       - cron: '0 14 * * *'  # 9 AM New York
       - cron: '0 17 * * *'  # 9 AM San Francisco

               echo "active_region=asia" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
             elif [ $CURRENT_HOUR_UTC -ge 8 ] && [ $CURRENT_HOUR_UTC -lt 14 ]; then
               echo "active_region=europe" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
             elif [ $CURRENT_HOUR_UTC -ge 14 ] && [ $CURRENT_HOUR_UTC -lt 22 ]; then

## Examples

```bash
# ❌ BAD: Synchronous-dependent workflow
# "Let's discuss this in the morning standup"
# "Can we have a quick call about this PR?"
# "Blocked waiting for John to come online"
# European team blocked on US decisions
# Asian team re-doing European work due to poor handoff

# ✅ GOOD: Async-first workflow
# Every PR includes comprehensive context
# Decisions documented in PR/commit messages
# Clear handoff between time zones
# Work progresses 24/7 without blocking
# "Follow the sun" development model
```

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Time zone-ignorant process
code_review:
  sla: "4 hours"  # Impossible across time zones
  require_sync_discussion: true
  approval_from: specific_person
  # Bottlenecks and delays

# ✅ GOOD: Time zone-aware process
code_review:
  sla: "1 business day in reviewer's timezone"
  async_first: true
  approval_from: any_team_member_in_region
  handoff_procedures:
    - comprehensive PR description
    - decision rationale documented
    - next steps clearly outlined
  regions:
    - asia: [tokyo, bangalore, sydney]
    - europe: [london, berlin, moscow]
    - americas: [nyc, chicago, sf, sao_paulo]
```

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Assuming everyone is available
async function requestReview(pr: PullRequest) {
  // Just assign to team lead
  await assignReviewer(pr, 'team-lead');
  await sendSlackMessage('Please review ASAP');
  // Team lead is asleep, PR blocked for 12 hours
}

// ✅ GOOD: Time zone-intelligent assignment
async function requestReview(pr: PullRequest) {
  const activeRegions = getActiveRegions();
  const availableReviewers = await getReviewersInRegions(activeRegions);

  // Assign based on expertise AND availability
  const reviewer = selectOptimalReviewer(availableReviewers, pr);

  await assignReviewer(pr, reviewer);
  await createHandoffNote(pr, {
    currentRegion: pr.author.region,
    assignedRegion: reviewer.region,
    context: pr.context,
    expectedReviewTime: calculateSLA(reviewer.timezone)
  });

  // Work continues flowing across time zones
}
