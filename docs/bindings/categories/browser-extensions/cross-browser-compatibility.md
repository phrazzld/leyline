# Binding: Design Browser Extensions for Cross-Browser Compatibility with Graceful Degradation

Build extensions that work across multiple browsers by using standard APIs, detecting capabilities, and providing fallbacks for browser-specific functionality. Prioritize portability while leveraging browser strengths appropriately.

## Rationale

This binding implements our adaptability-and-reversibility tenet by ensuring extensions can adapt to different browser environments and evolve as browser capabilities change. Browser-specific extensions create vendor lock-in for users and maintenance overhead for developers. When extensions work across browsers, users have freedom to choose their preferred browser without losing functionality.

Think of cross-browser compatibility like designing a tool that works with different power outlets around the world. A well-designed device includes universal adapters or can work with multiple voltage standards, rather than being permanently hardwired for a single region. Similarly, cross-browser extensions use standard APIs and graceful degradation to work reliably regardless of the user's browser choice.

This binding also supports our simplicity tenet by encouraging the use of standard, well-supported APIs rather than browser-specific experimental features that add complexity and fragility.

## Rule Definition

This binding establishes requirements for cross-browser extension development:

- **API Standard Usage**: Prioritize standard, widely-supported APIs:
  - Use WebExtensions APIs that work across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
  - Avoid browser-specific APIs unless they provide critical functionality
  - Implement feature detection before using newer APIs
  - Document browser-specific limitations and workarounds

- **Capability Detection**: Implement runtime feature detection:
  - Check for API availability before use
  - Provide fallback functionality for missing capabilities
  - Gracefully degrade when advanced features aren't available
  - Inform users about browser-specific limitations when relevant

- **Manifest Compatibility**: Handle manifest differences across browsers:
  - Use Manifest V3 standards where possible
  - Provide browser-specific manifest files when necessary
  - Test manifest validation across target browsers
  - Document manifest differences and their impact

- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive cross-browser testing:
  - Automated testing on all supported browsers
  - Manual testing of critical user workflows
  - Regular testing on browser beta/dev channels
  - Performance testing across different browser engines

## Implementation

Build extensions that work reliably across browsers:

1. **Polyfill Strategy**: Use polyfills for consistent API access:
   - Implement webextension-polyfill for API normalization
   - Create custom polyfills for missing functionality
   - Test polyfill behavior across browsers
   - Document polyfill usage and limitations

2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Design for basic functionality first:
   - Core features work on all browsers
   - Enhanced features available on supporting browsers
   - Clear UI indication of browser-specific features
   - Alternative workflows for unsupported capabilities

3. **Browser-Specific Builds**: Handle significant differences appropriately:
   - Use build tools to generate browser-specific packages
   - Maintain shared core code with browser-specific adaptations
   - Test build variations thoroughly
   - Document build process and browser differences

4. **User Communication**: Inform users about browser capabilities:
   - Display browser compatibility information
   - Provide installation instructions for each browser
   - Explain feature differences when relevant
   - Offer migration assistance between browsers

## Anti-patterns

- **Single Browser Focus**: Designing only for Chrome/Chromium
- **Untested Assumptions**: Assuming APIs work identically across browsers
- **Hard Dependencies**: Requiring browser-specific features for core functionality
- **Inconsistent UI**: Different user experiences across browsers without justification
- **Outdated Testing**: Not testing on current browser versions

## Enforcement

This binding should be enforced through:

- **Cross-Browser CI**: Automated testing on all supported browsers
- **Compatibility Audits**: Regular review of browser-specific code and dependencies
- **User Feedback Monitoring**: Tracking browser-specific issues and requests
- **Standards Compliance**: Validation against WebExtensions standards

## Exceptions

Valid cases for browser-specific functionality:

- **Platform Integration**: Features that leverage browser-specific OS integration
- **Performance Optimization**: Browser-specific optimizations for critical functionality
- **Security Features**: Browser-specific security capabilities
- **Experimental Features**: Opt-in functionality using cutting-edge APIs

Always provide alternative experiences for other browsers when possible.
