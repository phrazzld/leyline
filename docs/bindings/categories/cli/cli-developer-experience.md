# Binding: Prioritize Exceptional CLI Developer Experience

Design command-line interfaces that anticipate developer needs and provide helpful, discoverable interactions. CLI tools must offer clear help documentation, intuitive argument patterns, meaningful error messages, and composable interfaces that integrate seamlessly with existing developer workflows.

## Rationale

This binding implements our empathize-with-your-user tenet by recognizing that CLI tool users are developers working under time pressure, often context-switching between multiple tools and tasks throughout their day.

Think of CLI design like creating the cockpit of an aircraft. Pilots need immediate access to critical information, clear feedback about system status, and intuitive controls that work reliably under pressure. Similarly, developers using CLI tools need immediate understanding of available options, clear feedback about what's happening, and predictable behavior that doesn't require consulting documentation for routine operations.

Poor CLI design creates cognitive overhead that compounds throughout a developer's day. When a tool requires mental effort to remember argument formats, provides cryptic error messages, or behaves inconsistently with established conventions, it breaks the developer's flow and adds friction to their work. By contrast, well-designed CLI tools fade into the background, becoming natural extensions of a developer's thought process rather than obstacles to overcome.

The investment in exceptional CLI experience pays dividends through increased adoption, reduced support burden, and improved developer productivity. When developers can use your tools confidently and efficiently, they become advocates rather than reluctant users.

## Rule Definition

This rule applies to all command-line interfaces, including standalone tools, build scripts, deployment utilities, and development automation. The rule specifically requires:

- **Discoverable Help**: Every command must provide meaningful help via `--help` or `-h` flags
- **Intuitive Arguments**: Command structure should follow established conventions and be memorable
- **Clear Error Messages**: Failures must explain what went wrong and suggest corrective actions
- **Composable Design**: Tools should work well with pipes, redirects, and other CLI patterns
- **Consistent Behavior**: Exit codes, output formats, and argument patterns should be predictable

The rule prohibits CLI designs that require users to remember complex syntax, provide unhelpful error messages, or break standard Unix conventions without clear justification.

Exceptions may be appropriate for domain-specific tools where standard conventions conflict with specialized requirements, but these must be documented with clear rationale.

## Practical Implementation

1. **Design Help First**: Before implementing functionality, design the help output that explains your tool's purpose, available commands, and common usage patterns. This forces you to clarify the tool's interface before writing code.

2. **Follow Established Conventions**: Use standard patterns for flags (`--verbose`, `--help`), configuration (`--config path`), and output formatting. Developers have muscle memory for these patterns, and breaking them creates unnecessary friction.

3. **Implement Progressive Disclosure**: Start with simple, common use cases and provide advanced options that don't overwhelm new users. Use subcommands or optional flags to expose complexity only when needed.

4. **Provide Meaningful Error Messages**: When operations fail, explain what the tool was trying to do, why it failed, and what the user can do to fix the problem. Include relevant context like file paths, configuration values, or system requirements.

5. **Test CLI Interactions**: Create automated tests for CLI behavior, including help output, error conditions, and edge cases. Include manual testing protocols that verify the tool works as expected in realistic developer workflows.

## Examples

```bash
# ❌ BAD: Cryptic error message
$ deploy-tool push
Error: 500

# ✅ GOOD: Helpful error with actionable guidance
$ deploy-tool push
Error: Deployment failed - target environment 'staging' not found

Available environments:
  - development
  - production

Use 'deploy-tool push --environment production' or configure staging environment first.
See 'deploy-tool env --help' for environment management.
```

```bash
# ❌ BAD: Non-discoverable command structure
$ mytool --operation=build --target-env=prod --enable-feature-x=true

# ✅ GOOD: Intuitive subcommands and flags
$ mytool build --environment production --enable feature-x
$ mytool build --help  # Provides clear guidance on available options
```

```bash
# ❌ BAD: Breaks Unix conventions, non-composable
$ mytool process input.txt
# (Overwrites input.txt, no way to pipe to other tools)

# ✅ GOOD: Composable design respecting Unix principles
$ mytool process input.txt > output.txt
$ cat input.txt | mytool process --stdin | grep "pattern"
$ mytool process input.txt --output-format json | jq '.results'
```

```bash
# ❌ BAD: Inconsistent exit codes and silent failures
$ mytool validate config.yml
$ echo $?  # Returns 0 even when validation fails

# ✅ GOOD: Proper exit codes and clear status reporting
$ mytool validate config.yml
✓ Configuration valid: 12 rules passed
$ echo $?  # Returns 0 for success

$ mytool validate invalid-config.yml
✗ Configuration invalid: 3 errors found
  - Line 15: 'timeout' must be a positive integer
  - Line 23: Required field 'api_key' is missing
  - Line 31: Unknown option 'enable_debug_mode'
$ echo $?  # Returns 1 for validation failure
```
