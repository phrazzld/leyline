# Binding: Implement Seamless Extension Updates with Clear Change Communication

Design update mechanisms that deliver improvements safely and transparently, with clear communication about changes, especially those affecting permissions or user experience. Balance automatic updates with user control.

## Rationale

This binding implements our deliver-value-continuously tenet by ensuring that improvements and fixes reach users efficiently while maintaining trust through transparency. Browser extensions auto-update by default, making update quality and communication critical for user retention. Poor update experiences can instantly break user workflows or violate user expectations about privacy and functionality.

Think of extension updates like software updates for medical devices or vehicle systems. Users depend on these tools for important workflows, so updates must be reliable, well-tested, and communicated clearly. Just as medical device updates require careful validation and clear change documentation, extension updates need thorough testing and transparent communication about changes that could affect user experience or data handling.

This binding also supports our adaptability-and-reversibility tenet by designing update processes that can handle rollbacks and gradual rollouts when issues arise.

## Rule Definition

This binding establishes requirements for extension update management:

- **Update Communication**: Provide clear information about changes:
  - Changelog accessible within the extension and in store listings
  - Highlight permission changes and their impact
  - Explain new features and their benefits
  - Document breaking changes and migration paths

- **Gradual Rollout Strategy**: Implement staged update deployment:
  - Beta testing with opt-in users before wide release
  - Gradual rollout percentages for major changes
  - Monitoring systems to detect update-related issues
  - Rollback capability for problematic releases

- **Permission Change Handling**: Manage permission updates carefully:
  - Avoid adding new permissions unless absolutely necessary
  - Provide in-extension explanation when new permissions are required
  - Use optional permissions for new features when possible
  - Consider feature flags for changes requiring new permissions

- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility during updates:
  - Preserve user settings and data across updates
  - Migrate configurations gracefully
  - Maintain API stability for content scripts
  - Test update paths from multiple previous versions

## Implementation

Design update processes that serve users effectively:

1. **Version Strategy**: Use semantic versioning to communicate change impact:
   - Major versions for breaking changes or new permissions
   - Minor versions for new features with backwards compatibility
   - Patch versions for bug fixes and security updates

2. **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive update testing:
   - Automated testing across browser versions
   - Manual testing of critical user workflows
   - Beta user testing for major changes
   - Rollback testing to ensure recovery capability

3. **Communication Channels**: Multiple ways to inform users about changes:
   - In-extension changelog or what's new dialog
   - Extension store update descriptions
   - Optional email notifications for major changes
   - Support documentation updates

4. **Monitoring and Response**: Track update success and user impact:
   - Error rate monitoring post-update
   - User feedback collection and response
   - Performance metrics comparison
   - Permission grant rate tracking for new permissions

## Anti-patterns

- **Silent Breaking Changes**: Updates that change behavior without warning
- **Permission Creep**: Gradually adding permissions without clear justification
- **Update Fatigue**: Too frequent updates for minor changes
- **Poor Rollback**: No way to recover from problematic updates
- **Ignored Feedback**: Not responding to user reports about update issues

## Enforcement

This binding should be enforced through:

- **Update Testing Protocols**: Required testing procedures before release
- **Change Review Process**: Review of user-facing changes and communication
- **Feedback Monitoring**: Systematic tracking of update-related user feedback
- **Rollback Procedures**: Documented and tested rollback capabilities

## Exceptions

Valid variations in update strategy:

- **Security Updates**: May require immediate deployment without gradual rollout
- **Store Policy Changes**: Updates required for continued store availability
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: May need expedited release processes
- **End-of-Life Browsers**: May have different update support timelines

Always prioritize user communication even in exceptional circumstances.
