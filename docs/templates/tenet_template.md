# Tenet: \[Principle Name\]

\[A concise 1-2 sentence principle statement that captures the essence of this tenet in
plain, accessible language. Focus on what this principle means rather than how to
implement it.\]

## Core Belief

\[Write a 2-4 paragraph natural language explanation of the underlying principle. Focus
primarily on the "why" this principle matters. Use a conversational, accessible style
that explains the value and purpose of this tenet.

Consider using analogies to make abstract concepts more relatable (e.g., "Think of
complexity like debtâ€”it accrues interest over time"). Analogies help readers connect
technical concepts to familiar experiences.

Emphasize the reasoning and benefits behind following this principle. Connect it to
broader software engineering values. This section should help someone understand not
just what the principle is, but why it's important enough to be a fundamental tenet.

Consider addressing what the principle is NOT to counter common misconceptions. For
example: "This principle isn't about cutting corners, but rather about finding elegant
solutions with the least moving parts." This helps clarify the boundaries of the
principle.\]

## Practical Guidelines

\[Provide a bulleted list of concrete ways this principle manifests in development
practices. Each guideline should be actionable but focused on patterns rather than
specific technical implementations. Include direct questions that developers can ask
themselves when applying these guidelines.\]

1. **\[Guideline Title\]**: \[Explanation of the guideline in natural language. Focus on
   the pattern and principle rather than specific syntax or technical details. Include
   direct questions that developers can ask themselves, e.g., "When considering a new
   abstraction, ask: 'Do we have concrete evidence we'll need this flexibility?'"\]

1. **\[Guideline Title\]**: \[Explanation that connects this guideline back to the core
   belief. Include the reasoning behind this guideline and how it supports the larger
   principle. Make this detailed enough (2-4 sentences) to provide meaningful
   guidance.\]

1. **\[Guideline Title\]**: \[Explanation that might include a brief illustrative
   example if helpful, but still focusing on the pattern rather than implementation
   details. Consider including both what to do and what to avoid.\]

1. **\[Guideline Title\]**: \[Explanation that differentiates between different contexts
   or situations where this guideline applies differently. Help readers understand
   nuances in application of the principle.\]

1. **\[Guideline Title\]**: \[Explanation that addresses common misconceptions or
   challenges with implementing this guideline. Include strategies for overcoming these
   challenges.\]

## Warning Signs

\[Provide a bulleted list of indicators that this principle is being violated. These
should be written in natural language with enough context to be understood. Bold the key
pattern or behavior for emphasis, and consider including phrases to listen for in
discussions.\]

- **\[Key Warning Pattern\]** \[Warning sign described as a behavior or pattern that
  indicates a violation of this principle. Include specific details about why this is
  problematic and how it violates the principle.\]

- **\[Key Warning Pattern\]** \[Warning sign with a brief explanation of why this is
  problematic. Include concrete examples of what this might look like in practice.\]

- **\[Key Warning Pattern\]** \[Warning sign that might include typical justifications
  given, and why they don't outweigh the principle. Include phrases to listen for, e.g.,
  "We might need this later" or "Just to be safe."\]

- **\[Key Warning Pattern\]** \[Warning sign that connects back to the core belief,
  showing how this behavior undermines the fundamental principle.\]

- **\[Key Warning Pattern\]** \[Warning sign that highlights long-term consequences of
  violation. Explain what happens over time when this warning sign is ignored.\]

- **\[Key Warning Pattern\]** \[Warning sign that might be subtle or easy to miss. These
  often appear innocent but can lead to significant problems later.\]

## Related Tenets

\[Links to related tenets with brief explanations of the relationships. Explain how this
tenet connects to, supports, or is in tension with other tenets. Focus on how they work
together to achieve broader goals.\]

  how these tenets work together or complement each other. Explain how following both
  leads to better outcomes.\]
