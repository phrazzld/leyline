# TypeScript Binding Enforcement Strictness

**Date:** 2025-06-18
**Status:** Decided
**Context:** Issue #87 - TypeScript bindings implementation

## Decision

**Use tiered enforcement with hard failures for essential quality gates and progressive enhancement for developer experience, including emergency override mechanisms with full audit trails.**

## Rationale

Based on leyline's progressive enhancement, fail-fast validation, and automated quality gates principles:

### **Essential vs Enhancement Balance**
- **Hard failures** for security, correctness, and data integrity issues
- **Warnings with guidance** for style, optimization, and best practice violations
- **Emergency overrides** for critical production fixes with documented approval
- **Progressive adoption** allowing teams to adapt before adding complexity

### **Developer Experience Priority**
- **Fast feedback loops**: Keep local checks under 30 seconds
- **Clear remediation guidance**: Every failure includes specific fix instructions
- **Context-aware enforcement**: Different strictness for local vs CI vs production
- **Learning opportunities**: Use quality gates for education, not punishment

## Implementation Guidelines

### **Tier 1: Essential Quality Gates (Hard Failures)**
Critical issues that must block commits and deployments:

```yaml
essential_gates:
  security:
    - secret_detection: "FAIL"      # Hardcoded secrets in configuration
    - dependency_vulnerabilities: "FAIL"  # Known CVEs in dependencies
  correctness:
    - yaml_validation: "FAIL"       # Invalid YAML front-matter
    - reference_integrity: "FAIL"   # Broken tenet references
    - type_errors: "FAIL"          # TypeScript compilation errors
  data_integrity:
    - config_validation: "FAIL"     # Invalid configuration examples
    - build_success: "FAIL"        # Failed builds from documented config
```

**Enforcement Examples:**
```bash
# Pre-commit hook (essential only, <30 seconds)
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔒 Essential Quality Gates"
ruby tools/validate_front_matter.rb --fail-fast || exit 1
ruby tools/fix_cross_references.rb --validate || exit 1
npm run typecheck || exit 1
echo "✅ Essential checks passed"
```

### **Tier 2: Enhanced Quality Gates (Warnings → Failures)**
Important but non-critical issues, introduced progressively:

```yaml
enhanced_gates:
  style:
    - linting_violations: "WARN → FAIL"  # After 2-4 weeks adaptation
    - formatting_issues: "WARN → FAIL"   # After team tool adoption
  optimization:
    - bundle_size_limits: "WARN"         # Performance monitoring
    - dependency_bloat: "WARN"           # Unnecessary dependencies
  best_practices:
    - test_coverage: "WARN → FAIL"       # Gradual coverage improvement
    - documentation_completeness: "WARN" # Encourage good practices
```

**Progressive Timeline:**
- **Week 1-2**: Warnings only, team education and tool setup
- **Week 3-4**: Convert style violations to failures after adaptation
- **Week 5+**: Full enforcement with override mechanisms

### **Tier 3: Comprehensive Gates (Future Enhancement)**
Advanced validation for mature teams:

```yaml
comprehensive_gates:
  architecture:
    - circular_dependencies: "WARN"      # Architectural quality
    - complexity_metrics: "WARN"         # Code maintainability
  performance:
    - benchmark_regressions: "WARN"      # Performance monitoring
    - resource_usage: "WARN"             # Memory/CPU tracking
```

### **Emergency Override Mechanisms**
For critical production fixes and edge cases:

```bash
# Emergency bypass with audit trail
git commit -m "hotfix: critical security patch

OVERRIDE_REASON: Production security vulnerability CVE-2024-XXXX
APPROVER: @security-lead
FOLLOW_UP_ISSUE: #1234
BYPASS_GATES: linting,formatting

This bypasses non-essential quality gates for emergency deployment."
```

**Override Requirements:**
- **Documented justification** for each bypassed gate
- **Approver identification** with appropriate authority
- **Follow-up issue creation** for technical debt remediation
- **Full audit trail** in commit messages and CI logs
- **Time-limited scope** (emergency fixes only)

### **Context-Aware Enforcement Levels**

**Local Development:**
```json
{
  "enforcement": "essential_only",
  "speed_target": "30_seconds",
  "feedback": "immediate",
  "overrides": "developer_discretion"
}
```

**Pull Request CI:**
```json
{
  "enforcement": "essential_plus_enhanced",
  "speed_target": "5_minutes",
  "feedback": "comprehensive",
  "overrides": "team_lead_approval"
}
```

**Production Deployment:**
```json
{
  "enforcement": "all_gates",
  "speed_target": "complete_validation",
  "feedback": "audit_trail",
  "overrides": "emergency_only"
}
```

### **Clear Remediation Guidance**
Every failure must include actionable fix instructions:

```bash
❌ YAML Validation Failed
   File: docs/bindings/categories/typescript/vitest-testing.md
   Issue: Missing required field 'tools' in front-matter

   Fix: Add the following to your YAML front-matter:
   tools:
     - vitest
     - typescript

   Documentation: See docs/templates/binding_template.md
   Help: Run `ruby tools/validate_front_matter.rb --help`
```

## Consequences

### **Positive**
- **Fast feedback** on critical issues when developer has full context
- **Gradual adaptation** prevents overwhelming teams with sudden quality gates
- **Emergency flexibility** maintains deployment velocity for critical fixes
- **Educational value** helps developers learn standards through clear guidance
- **Compliance confidence** ensures essential quality standards are consistently met

### **Negative**
- **Implementation complexity** requires tiered automation and progressive rollout
- **Override governance** needs clear approval processes and audit mechanisms
- **Team coordination** required for progressive enhancement timeline
- **Monitoring overhead** to track gate effectiveness and adaptation progress

## Compliance with Leyline Principles

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with essential gates, add complexity based on team readiness
- **Fail-Fast Validation**: Critical issues caught immediately with clear remediation
- **No Secret Suppression**: Override mechanisms require justification and audit trails
- **Automated Quality Gates**: Comprehensive automation with context-aware enforcement
- **Developer Experience**: Fast feedback loops and educational approach to quality
- **80/20 Solution**: Focus enforcement on 20% of checks that catch 80% of issues
