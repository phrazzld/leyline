**Date:** 2025-06-12
**Status:** Roadmap
**Context:** T013 - Prioritize tier 2/3 advanced security patterns for future roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap identifies 12 advanced security patterns for Tier 2/3 implementation, building upon the foundational security binding category. Patterns are prioritized based on impact, implementation complexity, and strategic alignment with development workflows.

**Priority 1 (High Impact, Medium Effort):** Incident Response Automation, API Security Patterns, Container Security Standards
**Priority 2 (High Impact, High Effort):** Zero-Trust Architecture, Advanced Cryptography, Security Testing Automation
**Priority 3 (Medium Impact, Variable Effort):** Compliance Automation, Privacy Engineering, Infrastructure Security

## Current Security Binding Foundation

### Established Coverage (Tier 1 - Complete)

1. **secure-by-design-principles**: Architecture-level security integration with STRIDE threat modeling
2. **input-validation-standards**: Multi-layer input sanitization and injection prevention
3. **authentication-authorization-patterns**: Identity management and access control frameworks
4. **secrets-management-practices**: Comprehensive credential lifecycle management
5. **secure-coding-checklist**: Automated security validation in development workflows

### Identified Gaps

### Implementation Quality Metrics
- Documentation completeness and consistency with Tier 1 bindings
- Cross-reference integration with existing security and core bindings
- Validation tool compatibility and enhancement opportunities

## Strategic Considerations

### Alignment with Existing Architecture
All Tier 2/3 patterns must:
- Build upon the foundational Tier 1 security bindings
- Integrate seamlessly with core bindings (automation, explicit-over-implicit, etc.)
- Follow established binding documentation standards
- Provide concrete enforcement mechanisms and validation approaches

### Technology Evolution
Priority ranking considers:
- **Current relevance:** Immediate applicability to modern development practices
- **Future-proofing:** Alignment with emerging security trends (zero-trust, cloud-native)
- **Industry adoption:** Alignment with established security frameworks and standards

### Resource Optimization
Implementation approach optimizes for:
- **Incremental value:** Each pattern provides standalone value while building toward comprehensive coverage
- **Parallel development:** P1 patterns can be developed concurrently by different team members
- **Learning integration:** Lessons from Tier 1 implementation inform Tier 2/3 approach

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a strategic approach to extending Leyline's security capabilities beyond the foundational Tier 1 bindings. The prioritization focuses on completing the security lifecycle (adding response to prevention/detection) while building toward modern architectural patterns (zero-trust, container-native, API-centric).

**Immediate Action:** Begin with Priority 1 patterns to achieve comprehensive security lifecycle coverage within 3 months, establishing Leyline as a complete security framework for modern development practices.
