algorithms, data structures... | | [explicit-over-implicit](./explicit-over-implicit.md)
| Software development is fundamentally about managing complexity, and explicitness is
one | | [maintainability](./maintainability.md) | Most of a software project's lifetime
is spent in maintenance mode. The code you write today will be read, modified, and
debugged dozens or hundred... | | [modularity](./modularity.md) | Modularity is the
fundamental approach for taming complexity in software systems. When | |
[no-secret-suppression](./no-secret-suppression.md) | Software quality tools—linters,
type checkers, test suites, security scanners—represent your first and most reliable
line of defense against defect... | | [simplicity](./simplicity.md) | Simplicity is a
fundamental requirement for building high-quality, maintainable software, not just a
nice-to-have goal. When you write simple code,... | | [testability](./testability.md) |
Testable code is inherently better code. When you design your systems with testability |
