# Data Files

This directory contains data files used by the Leyline project:

- `binding-tenet-mapping.csv` - Maps binding IDs to their parent tenet IDs, providing a structured representation of the relationship between bindings and tenets.

These files should not be edited manually. They are either auto-generated or maintained through specific processes.
