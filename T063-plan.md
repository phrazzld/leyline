# T063 · Feature · P1: Rewrite simplicity tenet in natural language format

## Task Description
Rewrite the `simplicity.md` tenet document using the natural language approach defined in the new templates and style guide.

## Context
This is the first tenet rewrite in Phase 2 of the natural language rewrite project. The simplicity tenet is a fundamental principle in our development philosophy and should serve as a model for future tenet rewrites.

## Classification
**Simple** - This is primarily a single-file change with clear requirements based on existing templates and style guides.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Review Source Materials**
   - Review existing `simplicity.md` to understand the core principle
   - Review `docs/templates/tenet_template.md` for structure
   - Review `docs/STYLE_GUIDE_NATURAL_LANGUAGE.md` for tone and approach

2. **Structure the Rewrite**
   - Maintain required front-matter (id, last_modified)
   - Follow the template structure:
     - Concise principle statement
     - Core Belief section (2-4 paragraphs, conversational)
     - Practical Guidelines (bulleted list with actionable items)
     - Warning Signs (indicators of violation)
     - Related Tenets (with meaningful connections)

3. **Apply Natural Language Style**
   - Use active voice and conversational tone
   - Address the reader directly
   - Use analogies to make abstract concepts relatable
   - Start with "why" before "what" and "how"
   - Follow narrative structure (problem → principle → solution → examples)

4. **Validate**
   - Ensure all front-matter is preserved and valid
   - Verify all internal links are correct
   - Check consistency with natural language style guide

## Work Process
1. Create draft rewrite in place (`docs/tenets/simplicity.md`)
2. Run validation tools to ensure format compliance
3. Update any cross-references if needed
4. Run the reindex tool to update the index file
5. Final review against style guide and templates

## Success Criteria
- Document passes validation with `tools/validate_front_matter.rb`
- Content follows natural language style guidelines
- Core principles from the original tenet are preserved
- Document provides clear, actionable guidance with appropriate tone
- All links and cross-references are valid
