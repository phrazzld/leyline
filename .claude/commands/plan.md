# Strategic Implementation Planner - Multi-Expert Analysis for Leyline

Create comprehensive implementation plans using legendary programmer perspectives and thorough research for the Leyline Ruby gem and knowledge repository system.

**Usage**: `/project:plan`

## GOAL

Generate the best possible implementation plan for the task described in TASK.md by:
- Conducting exhaustive research and context gathering
- Leveraging multiple expert programming personas through subagents
- Synthesizing diverse perspectives into a strongly opinionated recommendation
- Considering Leyline's unique architecture: Ruby CLI gem with caching infrastructure, content sync system, and knowledge management philosophy

## ANALYZE

Your job is to make the best possible implementation plan for the task described in TASK.md.

### Phase 1: Foundation Research
1. Read TASK.md thoroughly to understand requirements and constraints
2. Comb through the codebase to collect relevant context and patterns:
   - Ruby gem structure and Thor CLI framework usage
   - File caching system architecture in `lib/leyline/cache/`
   - Git sync functionality in `lib/leyline/sync/`
   - Performance optimization patterns (cache-aware sync)
   - Error handling and recovery strategies
3. Read relevant leyline documents in `./docs/leyline/` for foundational principles
4. Review CLAUDE.md for project-specific conventions and performance targets
5. Check TODO.md for task dependencies and project roadmap context
6. Use context7 MCP server to research Ruby gem best practices, Thor CLI patterns, and caching strategies
7. Conduct web searches on the problem domain, solutions, and best practices

### Phase 2: Multi-Expert Analysis
Launch parallel subagents embodying legendary programmer perspectives using the Task tool:

**Task 1: John Carmack Perspective**
- Prompt: "As John Carmack, analyze this task focusing on performance optimization, elegant algorithms, and first principles thinking. Consider Leyline's cache-aware sync performance targets (<1 second warm cache sync), SHA256 content addressing, and memory-efficient file operations. What would be the most algorithmically sound and performance-optimized approach?"

**Task 2: Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz) Perspective**
- Prompt: "As Yukihiro Matsumoto, analyze this task from Ruby philosophy, developer happiness, and principle of least surprise perspectives. How would you ensure the solution feels natural in Ruby, maintains elegant simplicity, and brings joy to developers using the Leyline gem?"

**Task 3: Linus Torvalds Perspective**
- Prompt: "As Linus Torvalds, analyze this task focusing on pragmatic engineering, git integration, and robust system design. Consider Leyline's git sync functionality, file system operations, and cache corruption recovery. What would be the most practical, no-nonsense approach that scales well and handles edge cases gracefully?"

**Task 4: Jeff Dean Perspective**
- Prompt: "As Jeff Dean, analyze this task from distributed systems, massive scale, and reliability engineering perspectives. Consider Leyline's cache statistics, performance monitoring, and concurrent file operations. How would you design this to handle enormous repositories, ensure reliability, and optimize for distributed environments?"

**Task 5: DHH (David Heinemeier Hansson) Perspective**
- Prompt: "As DHH, analyze this task focusing on Rails philosophy, convention over configuration, and developer ergonomics. Consider Leyline's CLI interface, optional parameters, and progressive disclosure of complexity. What approach would provide the most intuitive experience while maintaining power and flexibility?"

### Phase 3: Design Exploration
For each approach, consider:
- **Simplest solutions**: Most straightforward, minimal viable approaches using existing Ruby patterns
- **Complex solutions**: Comprehensive, feature-rich implementations with advanced caching strategies
- **Creative solutions**: Innovative, cut-the-gordian-knot style approaches leveraging Ruby metaprogramming
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combinations that leverage multiple methodologies

## EXECUTE

1. **Foundation Analysis**
   - Read and thoroughly understand TASK.md requirements
   - Map out current codebase patterns:
     * Thor CLI command structure and option parsing
     * File caching architecture with SHA256 content addressing
     * Git client integration patterns
     * Error handling and cache recovery mechanisms
     * RSpec testing patterns and fixtures
   - Research domain-specific best practices for Ruby gems, CLI tools, and file caching

2. **Launch Expert Subagents**
   - Use the Task tool to create independent subagents for each programming legend
   - Have each analyze the problem through their distinctive lens
   - Focus on Leyline-specific concerns: performance, reliability, developer experience
   - Collect their unique recommendations and implementation approaches

3. **Cross-Pollination Round**
   - Launch follow-up subagents that review all expert perspectives
   - Identify synergies and conflicts between different approaches
   - Generate hybrid solutions that combine the best insights
   - Consider Leyline's philosophy of pull-based content sync and knowledge management

4. **Synthesis and Evaluation**
   - Compare all approaches across multiple dimensions:
     * Technical feasibility within Ruby/Thor framework
     * Performance impact on cache-aware sync (<1s target)
     * Cache hit ratio maintenance (>80% target)
     * Maintainability following Leyline conventions
     * User experience for gem consumers
     * Implementation timeline considering TODO.md dependencies
   - Evaluate tradeoffs specific to Leyline:
     * Cache complexity vs. sync performance
     * Feature richness vs. simplicity
     * Flexibility vs. convention

5. **Strategic Recommendation**
   - Present the best implementation approach with clear rationale
   - Include specific architectural decisions:
     * Ruby module/class structure
     * Thor command integration patterns
     * Cache management strategies
     * Error handling approaches
   - Provide implementation phases aligned with TODO.md structure
   - Document alternative approaches and why they were not selected
   - Include success metrics:
     * Performance benchmarks (sync time, cache hit ratio)
     * Code quality metrics (RuboCop compliance, test coverage)
     * User experience indicators

## Leyline-Specific Considerations

- **Ruby Conventions**: Follow Ruby idioms, use appropriate modules/classes, leverage standard library
- **Thor CLI Framework**: Integrate seamlessly with existing CLI structure and option parsing
- **Cache Infrastructure**: Consider impact on file_cache.rb, cache_stats.rb, and cache_error_handler.rb
- **Git Integration**: Ensure compatibility with git_client.rb and sync workflows
- **Testing**: Design for RSpec testability with proper fixtures and integration tests
- **Performance**: Maintain <1 second warm cache sync and >80% cache hit ratio targets
- **Backward Compatibility**: Consider impact on existing gem users and migration paths

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive analysis incorporating multiple expert perspectives
- Clear, actionable implementation plan with strong technical rationale
- Consideration of both technical excellence and practical constraints
- Strategic approach that maximizes probability of successful execution
- Integration with existing Leyline patterns and Ruby conventions
- Performance optimization strategies that meet or exceed current benchmarks
- Testing strategy that ensures reliability and maintainability
