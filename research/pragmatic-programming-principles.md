Here is a concise summary of the key principles from "The Pragmatic Programmer" by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt.

### The Pragmatic Philosophy

At the heart of "The Pragmatic Programmer" is a philosophy centered on craftsmanship, personal responsibility, and adaptability.

* **Care About Your Craft**: Take pride in your work and strive for excellence. Good enough isn't enough when you can be better.
* **Think! About Your Work**: Actively engage with the problems you're solving. Don't operate on autopilot.
* **Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses**: Instead of saying something can't be done, explain what can be done.
* **Don't Live with Broken Windows**: Neglect accelerates software rot. Fix small problems as soon as you find them.
* **Be a Catalyst for Change**: Identify opportunities for improvement and gently guide your team and projects toward them.
* **Remember the Big Picture**: Don't get lost in the details; keep the overall goals of the project in mind.
* **Make Quality a Requirements Issue**: Involve users in defining the quality standards of the project.

### A Pragmatic Approach

This section focuses on the core principles of software design and development that lead to robust and maintainable code.

* **DRY – Don't Repeat Yourself**: Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
* **Make It Easy to Reuse**: If it's easy to reuse code and components, people will.
* **Orthogonality**: Design components that are self-contained and independent. Changes in one part shouldn't ripple through the entire system.
* **There Are No Final Decisions**: Treat decisions as reversible. Be prepared to adapt and change course.
* **Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target**: Fire small, fast, and visible pieces of the system to get early feedback and verify your aim.
* **Prototype to Learn**: Use prototypes to explore ideas, reduce risk, and learn, then throw the code away.
* **Program Close to the Problem Domain**: Use the language and abstractions of the user's domain in your code.

### The Basic Tools

Pragmatic programmers are masters of their tools and use them to enhance their productivity.

* **Keep Knowledge in Plain Text**: Plain text is durable, easy to manipulate, and less prone to obsolescence.
* **Use the Power of Command Shells**: Graphical user interfaces are helpful, but the shell is a powerful tool for automation and complex tasks.
* **Use a Single Editor Well**: Know your primary editor inside and out to make it an extension of your hands.
* **Always Use Source Code Control**: It's your project's time machine, allowing you to go back to any point in its history.

### Pragmatic Paranoia

This set of principles is about writing code that is defensive and handles the inevitable errors and exceptions gracefully.

* **Fix the Problem, Not the Blame**: It doesn't matter whose fault a bug is; it's your problem to fix it.
* **Don't Panic When Debugging**: Take a methodical approach to finding the root cause of a bug.
* **"select" Isn't Broken**: Assume the problem is in your code, not in the operating system or the compiler.
* **Don't Assume It—Prove It**: Test your assumptions with real data and in the target environment.
* **Write Code That Writes Code**: Use code generators to increase productivity and reduce duplication.
* **You Can't Write Perfect Software**: Aim for "good enough" software that meets the user's needs and is delivered on time.
* **Design with Contracts**: Use preconditions, postconditions, and invariants to specify and enforce what your code expects and guarantees.
* **Crash Early**: A program that crashes is often less harmful than one that continues to run in a corrupt state.

### While You Are Coding

These are tactical principles to apply during the act of writing code.

* **Listen to Your Lizard Brain**: Pay attention to your gut feelings; they are often based on subconscious pattern matching.
* **Programming by Coincidence**: Don't rely on luck or code that you don't understand. Know why your code works.
* **Refactor Early, Refactor Often**: Continuously improve the design of your code.
* **Test Your Software, or Your Users Will**: Thoroughly test your code at all levels.
* **Don't Use Wizard Code You Don't Understand**: If you can't tell your boss how the generated code works, you shouldn't be using it.

### Before the Project

These principles apply to the broader context of project management and team collaboration.

* **The Requirements Pit**: Help your users understand what they really want.
* **Solving the Impossible Puzzle**: Sometimes you need to step back and look at the problem from a different angle.
* **Working Together**: Effective teams are built on trust, communication, and shared goals.
* **Agile is Not a Noun; Agile is How You Do Things**: Focus on the iterative and feedback-driven nature of agile development.

### Pragmatic Teams

Finally, these principles guide how to build and participate in effective development teams.

* **Organize Around Functionality, Not Job Titles**: Teams should be cross-functional and focused on delivering features.
* **Don't Make Manual Procedures**: Automate everything, from builds to deployments.
* **Test Early, Test Often, Test Automatically**: Automation is key to a robust testing strategy.
* **Coding Ain't Done 'Til All the Tests Run**: A feature isn't complete until it's fully tested.
* **Sign Your Work**: Be proud of your contributions and take ownership of your code.
