```markdown
## Pragmatic Simplicity Principles

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Don't build features until they're actually needed. The future requirement
you're imagining may never materialize, or look completely different when it does.

### Good-Enough Software
Balance perfection with practical delivery constraints. Perfect software is
often late software, and late software is often useless software.

### Tracer Bullet Development
Build end-to-end functionality early to get feedback and verify your aim.
Small, fast, visible progress beats perfect architecture planning.
```

**Philosophical Alignment:** ✅ No conflicts - enhances existing simplicity focus

### 2. Modularity Tenet - Enhancement Opportunities

```markdown
## Enhanced Testing Philosophy

### Test Ruthlessly
Test everything that could possibly break. If you don't test it,
your users will - and they won't be gentle about it.

### Test State Coverage Over Code Coverage
Focus on testing meaningful scenarios and edge cases rather than
achieving arbitrary code coverage percentages.

### Property-Based Testing
Test the invariants and properties of your system rather than
just specific input-output combinations.
```

**Philosophical Alignment:** ✅ Strengthens existing testing focus

**Enhancement Strategy:**
```markdown
## Professional Maintainability

### Gently Exceed Expectations
Consistently deliver just that little bit more than promised.
This builds trust and demonstrates craftsmanship.

### Sign Your Work
Take pride in your contributions. Code should reflect the
professionalism and skill of its author.

### Invest in Your Knowledge Portfolio
Treat learning like financial investment - diversify skills,
learn regularly, and manage risk through continuous growth.
```

**Philosophical Alignment:** ✅ Expands maintainability to include professional growth

### 5. Explicit-over-Implicit Tenet - Enhancement Opportunities

**Current Coverage:** Clear communication and dependency management
**Pragmatic Enhancements:**
- **Plain Text Power**: Use durable, manipulable text formats
- **Crash Early**: Detect and report problems immediately

**Enhancement Strategy:**
```markdown
## Enhanced Explicit Communication

### Plain Text Power
Keep knowledge in plain text - it's durable, easy to manipulate,
and less prone to obsolescence than proprietary formats.

### Crash Early
A program that crashes is often less harmful than one that
continues to run in a corrupt state. Fail fast and fail clearly.

### Command-Query Separation
Functions should either change state or return information,
but not both. This makes behavior predictable and explicit.
```
