______________________________________________________________________

## 1. Component Architecture (Atomic Design)

- **Atomic Design is Mandatory:** Structure components following the [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology to enable systematic UI composition and reuse.
- **Component Hierarchy:**
  - **Atoms:** Foundational UI primitives (buttons, inputs, typography, icons). **MUST** be:
    - Highly reusable
    - Stateless or with minimal self-contained state
    - Focused on a single responsibility
    - Styled according to the design system
  - **Molecules:** Combinations of atoms forming small, functional units (form groups, search bars, menu items). **MUST**:
    - Compose atoms without knowledge of the larger context
    - Handle simple interactions between constituent atoms
    - Maintain cohesive functionality
  - **Organisms:** Complex UI sections combining molecules and atoms (navigation, forms, content cards). **MUST**:
    - Represent distinct sections of the interface
    - Encapsulate related functionality
    - Form a meaningful unit within the application interface
  - **Templates:** Page-level layout components defining content structure without specific data.
  - **Pages:** Concrete implementations of templates that bring together organisms with actual data.
- **Folder Structure:** Organize components by atomic level and domain, not technical type.

## 2. Component Development Workflow (Storybook-First)

- **Storybook-First Development is Mandatory:** Components **MUST** be designed, developed, and documented in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) before integration into the application. This approach:
  - Enforces component-driven development
  - Ensures components work in isolation
  - Provides a living component library and documentation
  - Enables visual testing and review
- **Story Requirements:** Each component **MUST** have the following Storybook stories:
  - Default state/variant
  - All variant combinations (e.g., sizes, colors, states)
  - Interactive examples demonstrating behavior
  - Edge cases (long text, error states, loading states)
- **Storybook Documentation:** Component documentation in Storybook **MUST** include:
  - Purpose and usage
  - Props API documentation with types and descriptions
  - Usage examples
  - Any performance or accessibility considerations
- **Development Order:** The preferred component development workflow is:
  1. Define component requirements, API, and design
  1. Implement component with tests
  1. Create Storybook stories with documentation
  1. Review in isolation (UI, functionality, accessibility)
  1. Integrate into the application
- **Storybook Integration:** Storybook **MUST** be part of the CI pipeline, with:
  - Chromatic or similar visual testing
  - Accessibility checks (via addon-a11y)
  - Automated testing of component interactions

## 3. UI Library and Styling (shadcn/ui, Tailwind)

- **shadcn/ui as Foundation:** [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is our preferred component library foundation. It:
  - Provides accessible, customizable, and unstyled components
  - Follows best practices for component implementation
  - Integrates well with our atomic design approach
- **Extending shadcn/ui:** When extending shadcn/ui components:
  - Preserve accessibility features and behaviors
  - Maintain consistent API patterns
  - Document any deviations from standard shadcn/ui components
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is our preferred styling approach. It:
  - Promotes design system consistency
  - Reduces CSS complexity and bundle size
  - Enables responsive design directly in components
  - Pairs well with shadcn/ui
- **CSS-in-JS Usage:** Avoid CSS-in-JS solutions except for dynamic styles that cannot be achieved with Tailwind. If required, use a zero-runtime solution like [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/).
- **Design Tokens:** Leverage Tailwind's theme configuration to define and enforce design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, etc.).
- **Dark Mode:** All components **MUST** support both light and dark modes.

## 4. Testing Strategy (Component, Integration, E2E)

- **Multi-Level Testing Approach:**
  - **Component Tests:** Unit tests for individual components (atoms, molecules)
  - **Integration Tests:** Tests for composite components (organisms, templates)
  - **E2E Tests:** Critical user flows and application behaviors
- **Component Testing Requirements:**
  - Use [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for component tests
  - Test behavior, not implementation details
  - Cover all component variants and states
  - Ensure accessibility in tests (a11y testing)
- **Integration Testing:** Verify that component compositions work correctly and handle data properly.
- **E2E Testing is Mandatory:** [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) **MUST** be used to test critical user flows:
  - **Minimum Coverage:** All happy paths of core user journeys **MUST** have E2E test coverage
  - **Critical Error Paths:** Test important error scenarios (form validation, API failures)
  - **Visual Testing:** Integrate visual testing to catch unintended UI changes
- **Test Coverage Thresholds:**
  - Component tests: 90%+ for atoms and molecules
  - Integration tests: 85%+ for organisms and templates
  - E2E tests: 100% of critical user flows
- **Test Organization:** Co-locate tests with components. For E2E tests, organize by user flow or feature.

## 5. State Management

- **Minimalist State Management:** Following core principles of simplicity, use the most appropriate and minimal state management for the need:
  - **Component State:** Use React's `useState` for local component state
  - **Shared State:** Use React's Context API for state shared between related components
  - **Server State:** Use [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) (React Query) for server state and data fetching
  - **Form State:** Use [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for form state management
- **Global State:** For complex applications requiring global state, prefer [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) or Redux Toolkit for:
  - Predictable state updates
  - DevTools integration
  - Time-travel debugging
- **State Architecture:**
  - **Colocation:** Keep state as close as possible to where it's used
  - **Immutability:** All state updates **MUST** follow immutable patterns
  - **Normalized State:** Complex relational data should be normalized
  - **Atomic Updates:** State updates should be atomic and targeted

## 6. Performance Optimization

- **Core Metrics (Web Vitals):** Applications **MUST** consistently meet or exceed scores for:
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): \< 2.5 seconds
  - First Input Delay (FID): \< 100 milliseconds
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): \< 0.1
- **Required Optimizations:**
  - **Code Splitting:** Use dynamic imports for route-based and component-based code splitting
  - **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js Image component or equivalent with proper sizing and formats
  - **Font Optimization:** Use Web fonts with proper loading strategies (preconnect, font-display)
  - **Asset Optimization:** Minimize and compress all assets (images, fonts, JS, CSS)
- **Component Rendering Optimization:**
  - **Memoization:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` judiciously for expensive operations
  - **Virtualization:** Use virtualization for long lists (react-window, react-virtualized)
  - **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for off-screen content
- **Measurement and Monitoring:**
  - Implement real user monitoring (RUM)
  - Regularly audit and benchmark performance
  - Set performance budgets and enforce them in CI

## 7. Accessibility (a11y)

- **WCAG Compliance is Mandatory:** Applications **MUST** meet [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) standards at minimum.
- **Key Requirements:**
  - **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements must be accessible via keyboard
  - **Screen Reader Support:** Content must be properly structured for screen readers
  - **Color Contrast:** Text must meet minimum contrast ratios

## 8. Responsive Design

- **Mobile-First Approach is Mandatory:** All components and layouts **MUST** be designed and implemented with a mobile-first approach.
- **Breakpoint System:** Standardize on Tailwind's breakpoint system:
  - `sm`: 640px
  - `md`: 768px
  - `lg`: 1024px
  - `xl`: 1280px
  - `2xl`: 1536px
- **Implementation Requirements:**
  - Use relative units (rem, em) instead of pixels for typography and spacing
  - Components must adapt appropriately across all breakpoints
  - Avoid fixed widths that can cause overflow
  - Test on actual devices or accurate device emulators
- **Content Requirements:**
  - Implement appropriate content prioritization for smaller screens
