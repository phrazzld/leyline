# BACKLOG

- rewrite the tenets and bindings to be natural language first
  - they are used as extra context by large language models -- they do not always need to translate so directly to deterministic configurations or actions
- audit source philosophy files and ensure that every principle is properly extracted into a tenet or binding
- make language / context specific tenets/bindings more clearly broken up (perhaps with subdirectories rather than just file prefixes)
- add chrome browser extension tenets / bindings
- add tenets / bindings for the benefit of strongly opinionated design over endless configuration
  - is probably a binding tied to the simplicity tenet (at least) because it creates better ux and simplifies code if there aren't a gazillion knobs and levers
- stronger storybook tenets / bindings
