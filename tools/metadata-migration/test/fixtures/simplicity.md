# Tenet: Simplicity Above All

Prefer the simplest design that solves the problem completely. Complexity is the root
cause of most software defects, maintenance challenges, and cognitive overload.
Rigorously seek solutions with the fewest moving parts.

## Core Belief

Simplicity is a fundamental requirement for building high-quality, maintainable
software, not just a nice-to-have goal. When you write simple code, you're making an
investment in the future health of your project.

## Practical Guidelines

1. **Apply YAGNI Rigorously**: "You Aren't Gonna Need It" is more than just an
   acronymâ€”it's a mindset that challenges you to question every piece of code that isn't
   solving an immediate, demonstrated need.
