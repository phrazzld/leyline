## Chosen Approach
Implement comprehensive TSDoc comments across all exported functions, classes, and interfaces in the metadata migration tool, following TSDoc standards and focusing on explaining the "why" behind the code.

## Rationale
- The chosen approach aligns with the project's documentation philosophy by prioritizing self-documenting code and focusing comments on the rationale behind non-obvious decisions.
- It adheres to the TSDoc standard, ensuring consistency and compatibility with TypeScript documentation tools.
- By documenting parameters, return values, and exceptions, it makes API contracts explicit and immediately obvious.
- Including examples where helpful enhances the documentation's usefulness for both maintainers and users of the public API.

## Build Steps
1. Review all modules that need documentation:
   - src/types.ts
   - src/logger.ts
   - src/fileWalker.ts
   - src/metadataInspector.ts
   - src/legacyParser.ts
   - src/metadataConverter.ts
   - src/yamlSerializer.ts
   - src/fileRewriter.ts
   - src/backupManager.ts
   - src/cliHandler.ts
   - src/migrationEngine.ts
   - src/migrationOrchestrator.ts
   - src/nodeFileSystemAdapter.ts

2. Add module-level documentation explaining the purpose and role of each module in the overall system.

3. Document all exported functions with:
   - `@param` tags for parameters
   - `@returns` tag for return values
   - `@throws` tag for exceptions

4. Document all exported interfaces and classes with clear descriptions of their role and usage.

5. Include examples in the documentation where they can help clarify the usage or behavior of functions or classes.

6. Ensure that the documentation follows the TSDoc standards and is focused on explaining the "why" behind the code, not just the "how".

7. Review the documentation for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.

8. Verify that the documentation is helpful for both maintainers understanding the codebase and users of the public API.
