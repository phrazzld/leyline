## Chosen Approach

**Document All Exported Functions, Classes, and Interfaces in Each Module with TSDoc Comments, Focusing on the "Why" and Rationale, Following TSDoc Standards, and Including Examples Where Necessary**

## Rationale

1. **Simplicity**: This approach directly addresses the task without introducing unnecessary complexity. It ensures that each module and its exports are documented comprehensively.
2. **Modularity**: By documenting each module independently, we maintain modularity and ensure that each part of the system is self-contained in terms of documentation.
3. **Testability**: While documentation itself isn't directly testable, clear documentation aids in understanding and maintaining tests. It also helps in identifying the purpose and boundaries of each module, which is crucial for testing.
4. **Coding Standards**: Adhering to TSDoc standards ensures consistency and tooling support, which is aligned with our coding standards.
5. **Documentation Approach**: This approach focuses on the "why" and rationale, which is in line with our philosophy of documenting decisions, not just mechanics.

## Build Steps

1. **Module-level Documentation**:
   - Add a TSDoc comment at the top of each module explaining its purpose and role in the system.
   - Include a brief description of how it interacts with other modules.

2. **Function Documentation**:
   - Document all exported functions with TSDoc comments.
   - Use `@param` tags to describe parameters, `@returns` for return values, and `@throws` for exceptions.
   - Include the rationale and intent behind the function, not just its behavior.

3. **Interface and Type Documentation**:
   - Document all exported interfaces and types with TSDoc comments.
   - Explain the contract they define and their role in the system.
   - Provide examples of usage where applicable.

4. **Class Documentation**:
   - Document all exported classes with TSDoc comments.
   - Describe the responsibilities and usage of each class.
   - Include examples of how to instantiate and use the class.

5. **Examples and Context**:
   - Add examples to the documentation where helpful, especially for complex or critical parts of the system.
   - Ensure that the documentation provides enough context to understand the use cases and constraints of the module.

6. **Validation**:
   - Use a TSDoc linter to ensure that all exported entities are documented and that the documentation follows the TSDoc standards.
   - Review the documentation to ensure it is clear, concise, and provides the necessary context.

7. **Integration with Code**:
   - Ensure that the documentation is kept up-to-date with the code changes.
   - Use tools that can generate API documentation from the TSDoc comments to provide an up-to-date reference for users.

By following these steps, we ensure that all public exports are comprehensively documented, focusing on the "why" and providing clear API contracts, which is essential for both maintainers and users of the public API.
