## Chosen Approach
Manually add comprehensive TSDoc comments to all exported entities, focusing on rationale, explicit contracts, and alignment with development philosophy.

## Rationale
- **Simplicity:** This approach uses direct manual additions, avoiding tool overhead for minimal complexity and immediate adherence to TSDoc standards, outranking automated options that introduce unnecessary dependencies.
- **Modularity + strict separation:** Each comment is added per entity in its module, maintaining clear boundaries without coupling to external tools, unlike scripted options that could blur documentation and code concerns.
- **Testability:** Ensures no changes to code logic, preserving existing testability with minimal mocking, as opposed to automation that might require mocking tools and complicate verification.
- **Coding Standards:** Guarantees full compliance with mandatory TSDoc and philosophy guidelines (e.g., documenting "Why"), surpassing partial automation that risks incomplete or inaccurate comments.
- **Documentation Approach:** Prioritizes self-documenting code with rationale-focused comments, directly aligning with the philosophy's emphasis on explaining intent over mechanics, while rejecting automated generation that often produces generic, non-philosophy-compliant output.

## Build Steps
1. Review all listed modules (e.g., src/types.ts, src/logger.ts) to identify exported functions, classes, and interfaces.
2. For each exported entity, add TSDoc comments including descriptions, @param for parameters, @returns for return values, @throws for exceptions, and explicit rationale for the entity's purpose and system role.
3. Incorporate examples where helpful, ensuring they illustrate intent and usage without overcomplicating.
4. At the module level, add documentation explaining the module's purpose, system fit, and key responsibilities.
5. Verify all comments against TSDoc standards and philosophy (e.g., focus on "Why"), using existing CI linting for enforcement.
6. Test the updated codebase to confirm comments do not alter behavior, maintaining original test coverage.
7. Commit changes with Conventional Commits (e.g., "docs: add TSDoc comments to core modules") and include in the next PR for review.
