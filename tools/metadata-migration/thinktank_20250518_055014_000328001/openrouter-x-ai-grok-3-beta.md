## Chosen Approach
Implement TSDoc comments systematically across all modules using a template-driven, iterative process with automated validation.

## Rationale
- **Simplicity:** This approach uses straightforward templates and manual iteration, avoiding complex tools or over-engineering, aligning with the philosophy of "Simplicity First."
- **Modularity:** Documentation is isolated per module, maintaining strict separation and clear boundaries as per "Modularity is Mandatory."
- **Testability:** While not directly testable, the validation step ensures documentation presence, supporting "Design for Testability" by enforcing verifiable standards.
- **Coding Standards:** Adheres to TypeScript standards and leverages TSDoc, aligning with "Maximize Language Strictness" and explicitness in the Development Philosophy.
- **Documentation Approach:** Focuses on "Why" over "How," uses TSDoc for API contracts, and includes examples, matching the "Document Decisions, Not Mechanics" principle.

## Build Steps
1. **Create TSDoc Templates:** Develop standardized TSDoc comment templates for modules, functions, classes, interfaces, and types, covering purpose, parameters, returns, throws, and examples where applicable, based on tsdoc.org guidelines.
2. **Prioritize Modules:** Start with core modules (`src/types.ts`, `src/migrationEngine.ts`, `src/migrationOrchestrator.ts`) to establish documentation patterns, then proceed to supporting modules.
3. **Add Module-Level Documentation:** Write a module-level TSDoc comment at the top of each file, explaining the module's purpose, role in the system, and key interactions.
4. **Document Public Exports:** Add detailed TSDoc comments to all exported functions, classes, and interfaces, focusing on intent ("Why"), API contracts, parameters, return values, exceptions, and usage examples.
5. **Iterative Review:** Review documentation for clarity and completeness per module, ensuring it aids both maintainers and API users, aligning with "Maintainability Over Premature Optimization."
6. **Automate Validation:** Integrate a tool like `api-extractor` or `eslint-plugin-tsdoc` into the CI pipeline to enforce TSDoc presence and syntax for all public exports.
7. **Update README:** Enhance the project README with links to generated API documentation or key usage examples extracted from TSDoc comments for user accessibility.
