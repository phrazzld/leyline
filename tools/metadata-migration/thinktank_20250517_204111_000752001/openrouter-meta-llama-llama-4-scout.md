## Chosen Approach

Design integration tests for the metadata migration tool focusing on end-to-end workflow, real test fixtures, CLI options, and error handling.

## Rationale
- The approach aligns with the **Testing Strategy** and **Core Principles** outlined in the development philosophy, emphasizing integration tests that verify real interactions between components without internal mocking.
- It ensures **Simplicity** by testing the complete workflow from start to finish.
- **Modularity** is maintained by using real implementations of internal collaborators.
- **Testability** is ensured by avoiding internal mocking and focusing on observable behavior.
- **Coding Standards** are followed by using established testing frameworks and practices.

## Build Steps
1. **Identify Test Fixtures**: Utilize test fixtures in `test/fixtures/` to cover various scenarios, including valid legacy formats, YAML front-matter, no metadata, malformed metadata, and edge cases.
2. **Structure Test Cases**: Organize tests into categories based on the type of test, such as successful migrations, dry-run, backup creation, CLI option testing, and error handling.
3. **Implement End-to-End Tests**: Write tests that cover the complete migration workflow from start to finish, ensuring that the tool correctly processes files and handles different scenarios.
4. **Test CLI Integration**: Develop tests for the CLI handler to ensure it correctly parses arguments and options, and that it can be tested programmatically.
5. **Verify File Outputs**: Validate that the output files match the expected results, including the correctness of YAML front-matter and backup files.
6. **Ensure Idempotency**: Test that running the migration tool twice does not change the results, verifying idempotency.
7. **Test Error Handling**: Simulate various error scenarios, such as file system errors, invalid metadata, and CLI option errors, to ensure the tool handles them correctly.
