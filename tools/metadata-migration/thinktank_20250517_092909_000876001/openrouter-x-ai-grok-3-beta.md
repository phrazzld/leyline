## Chosen Approach
Implement MetadataConverter as a modular, pure TypeScript module with strict type safety and comprehensive error handling for transforming LegacyMetadata to StandardYamlMetadata.

## Rationale
- Simplicity is prioritized by focusing on a straightforward transformation logic in a single module, avoiding unnecessary abstractions or over-engineering, aligning with the core philosophy of "Simplicity First."
- Modularity is ensured through strict separation of concerns, with the MetadataConverter as an isolated unit that handles transformation without dependencies on infrastructure, supporting "Modularity is Mandatory."
- Testability is maximized by designing pure functions with clear interfaces, avoiding internal mocking, and enabling easy unit testing, adhering to "Design for Testability."
- Coding standards are strictly followed with TypeScript's strict type checking, immutable data patterns, and ESLint/Prettier enforcement, meeting the "Maximize Language Strictness" and related guidelines.
- Documentation approach focuses on self-documenting code with TSDoc comments for rationale and API contracts, aligning with "Document Decisions, Not Mechanics."

## Build Steps
1. Create `src/metadataConverter.ts` as the primary module file, defining interfaces for `LegacyMetadata` and `StandardYamlMetadata` with strict TypeScript types to ensure type safety.
2. Implement a pure function `convertMetadata` in `metadataConverter.ts` to transform `LegacyMetadata` to `StandardYamlMetadata`, handling data normalization and required field validation.
3. Add validation logic within `convertMetadata` to check for required fields, throwing custom error types (extending `Error`) with detailed messages for missing or invalid data.
4. Ensure immutability by using `readonly` properties in interfaces and immutable update patterns (e.g., spread syntax) during transformation to prevent accidental mutations.
5. Write comprehensive unit tests in `src/metadataConverter.test.ts`, co-located with the source, covering happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions using Jest or Vitest, adhering to testability principles.
6. Document the module with TSDoc comments in `metadataConverter.ts`, explaining the purpose, transformation logic rationale, and error handling approach for maintainability.
7. Configure CI pipeline checks to enforce TypeScript strictness (`tsc --noEmit`), linting (ESLint), formatting (Prettier), and test coverage thresholds (>85%) to ensure quality gates are met.
8. Review dependencies on tasks T004, T005, T006, and T009 to integrate necessary types or utilities, ensuring no circular dependencies and maintaining modularity.
