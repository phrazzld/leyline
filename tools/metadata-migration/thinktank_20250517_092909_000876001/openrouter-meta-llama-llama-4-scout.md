## Chosen Approach

Implement the MetadataConverter module with a focus on simplicity, modularity, testability, and adherence to coding standards.

## Rationale

- **Simplicity First:** The MetadataConverter module will be designed to perform a single, well-defined task: transforming LegacyMetadata to StandardYamlMetadata. This simplicity will ensure ease of understanding, debugging, and maintenance.
- **Modularity is Mandatory:** The module will be constructed as a standalone unit with a clear interface, allowing for easy integration and testing. This modularity will enable the MetadataConverter to be used independently or as part of a larger system.
- **Design for Testability:** The implementation will prioritize testability, with a focus on automated verification of the module's behavior. This will involve creating comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to ensure the module functions correctly.
- **Coding Standards:** The implementation will adhere to established coding standards, including those outlined in the DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md document. This will ensure consistency and readability across the codebase.

## Build Steps

1. Create the `src/metadataConverter.ts` file and define the module's interface and functionality.
2. Implement the transformation of LegacyMetadata to StandardYamlMetadata, including validation of required fields and normalization of formats.
3. Develop comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to verify the module's behavior.
4. Ensure the module adheres to established coding standards and best practices.
