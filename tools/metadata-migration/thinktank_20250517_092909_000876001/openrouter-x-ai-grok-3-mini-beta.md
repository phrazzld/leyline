## Chosen Approach
Implement the MetadataConverter module using a modular structure with strict separation of concerns, defining interfaces for validation and transformation to ensure testability and adherence to standards.

## Rationale
- **Simplicity:** This approach keeps the core logic straightforward by limiting each module to a single responsibility, avoiding unnecessary complexity while directly meeting task requirements, per the philosophy's emphasis on essential complexity.
- **Modularity + Strict Separation:** It employs TypeScript interfaces and separates validation and transformation into distinct modules, aligning with Hexagonal Architecture guidelines to enhance maintainability and isolate faults, outranking less modular options that could lead to coupled code.
- **Testability (Minimal Mocking):** By defining clear interfaces for dependencies, testing focuses on public APIs without internal mocks, adhering to the philosophy's rule against mocking internal collaborators and providing isolated unit tests.
- **Coding Standards:** Ensures compliance with TypeScript strictness (e.g., no `any`, immutability via `readonly`), pure functions for core logic, and error handling, directly addressing potential violations in simpler options.
- **Documentation Approach:** Generates self-documenting code through TSDoc comments on interfaces and modules, with external documentation focused on rationale, outperforming basic implementations that risk undocumented growth.

## Build Steps
1. Define TypeScript types and interfaces for LegacyMetadata, StandardYamlMetadata, and a converter interface (e.g., IMetadataConverter) in a shared types file (src/types/metadata.ts), ensuring immutability with `readonly` where applicable.
2. Create a validation module (src/metadataValidator.ts) that exports a pure function to check required fields and normalize formats, returning a Result-like type (e.g., using a custom error wrapper).
3. Implement the transformation module (src/metadataTransformer.ts) as a pure function that converts validated LegacyMetadata to StandardYamlMetadata, using utility types for type safety.
4. Assemble the main converter in src/metadataConverter.ts, composing the validation and transformation modules via dependency injection (e.g., passing functions as parameters), and implement the IMetadataConverter interface to enforce separation.
5. Add comprehensive TSDoc comments for all exports, focusing on rationale and usage, and integrate with CI for type checking and testing to verify transformations and edge cases.
