## Chosen Approach

Implement LegacyParser module focusing on simplicity, modularity, testability, and strict coding standards.

## Rationale
- **Simplicity First:** Break down the task into manageable parts, focusing on parsing raw metadata into a LegacyMetadata object. Resist adding unnecessary complexity.
- **Modularity:** Construct the LegacyParser from small, well-defined, independent components with clear responsibilities and explicit interfaces.
- **Design for Testability:** Structure code for easy and reliable automated verification. Focus tests on public API and behavior.
- **Coding Standards:** Adhere strictly to language-specific standards (e.g., TypeScript Appendix).

## Build Steps
1. Create `src/legacyParser.ts` with clear, descriptive naming and strict typing.
2. Analyze existing legacy formats (YAML front-matter, legacy horizontal rule) to understand variations.
3. Implement parsing logic for raw metadata into LegacyMetadata object.
4. Handle malformed data gracefully, logging errors appropriately.
5. Write comprehensive unit tests for parser functionality.

## Chosen Approach
Implement LegacyParser module focusing on simplicity, modularity, testability, and strict coding standards.

## Rationale
- The approach prioritizes simplicity by breaking down the task into manageable parts.
- Modularity ensures the parser is composed of independent, testable components.
- Strict coding standards (e.g., TypeScript) ensure maintainability and readability.

## Build Steps
1. Create `src/legacyParser.ts`.
2. Analyze legacy formats.
3. Implement parsing logic.
