# T030 Plan: Rewrite binding 'ts-no-any.md'

## Task Analysis
- Rewrite the 'ts-no-any.md' binding using the natural language first approach
- Apply the binding template structure consistently
- Create conversational content that works well for both human readers and LLMs
- Ensure proper front-matter validation

## Current State Assessment
- Need to review current binding content
- Need to understand TypeScript specific concepts around type safety and the `any` type
- Need to connect to relevant tenets (likely explicit-over-implicit or maintainability)

## Implementation Steps
1. Review current ts-no-any.md binding
2. Review related tenets to understand the foundational principles
3. Develop an appropriate analogy for TypeScript's any type and type safety
4. Structure the rewrite following the binding template:
   - Front-matter
   - Rule statement
   - Rationale with analogy
   - Rule definition
   - Practical implementation
   - Examples (good/bad)
   - Related bindings
5. Validate front-matter using validate_front_matter.rb
6. Update TODO.md to mark task as complete
7. Commit changes
8. Clean up plan file

## Success Criteria
- Binding clearly explains TypeScript's any type avoidance in natural language
- Content is accessible to both humans and LLMs
- Front-matter validation passes
- Document follows established binding structure
- Relationships with other bindings are clearly defined
