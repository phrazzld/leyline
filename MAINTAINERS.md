The maintainer is responsible for:

1. **Reviewing Pull Requests**:
   - Reviewing and merging changes to tenets and bindings
   - Ensuring quality and consistency of documentation

2. **Repository Governance**:
   - Enforcing code quality standards
   - Managing repository access and permissions
   - Ensuring the CI/CD pipeline remains functional
   - Approving and coordinating new releases

3. **Documentation**:
   - Maintaining accurate and up-to-date documentation
   - Reviewing documentation changes for clarity and correctness

4. **Community Support**:
   - Answering questions about Leyline
   - Guiding contributors on proper use of tenets and bindings
   - Helping consumer repositories with integration issues

## Becoming a Maintainer

To become a core maintainer:

1. Contribute regularly to the repository through pull requests
2. Demonstrate understanding of Leyline's principles and goals
3. Be nominated by an existing core maintainer
4. Receive approval from a majority of existing core maintainers

## Maintainer Nomination Process

1. Nomination is made by opening an issue with the title: "Core Maintainer Nomination: [GitHub Username]"
2. The nomination should include:
   - Nominee's contributions to Leyline
   - Reasons for nomination
   - Specific areas of expertise

3. Core maintainers will discuss and vote on the nomination
4. Upon approval, the repository admin will add the new maintainer to the team

## Removing a Maintainer

A maintainer may step down at any time by informing the team. Additionally, maintainers who are inactive for 6+ months without prior notice may be removed to ensure active governance.

## Decision Making Process

The core maintainers team strives for consensus in decisions. When consensus cannot be reached:

1. For technical decisions: The team will vote, with a simple majority required
2. For governance decisions: A 2/3 majority is required
3. The lead maintainer holds a tie-breaking vote

## Changes to This Document
