| [dependency-inversion](./dependency-inversion.md) | This binding directly implements our testability tenet by making code inherently more testable through decoupling. When your business logic depends... |
| [dependency-management](./dependency-management.md) | This binding implements our simplicity tenet by addressing a major source of hidden complexity: the sprawling dependency trees that frequently grow... |
| [external-configuration](./external-configuration.md) | This binding directly implements our no-secret-suppression tenet by preventing one of its most dangerous forms: hardcoded secrets and configuration... |
| [frontend-state-management](./frontend-state-management.md) | This binding directly implements our simplicity tenet by addressing one of the most common sources of frontend complexity: state management. As app... |
| [go-concurrency-patterns](./go-concurrency-patterns.md) | This binding directly implements our simplicity tenet by protecting against one of the most challenging sources of complexity in software — uncontr... |
| [go-error-wrapping](./go-error-wrapping.md) | This binding implements our explicit-over-implicit tenet by making error context and propagation paths visible rather than hidden. |

| [require-conventional-commits](./require-conventional-commits.md) | This binding directly implements our automation tenet by transforming commit messages from unstructured text into structured data that can drive au... |
| [rust-error-handling](./rust-error-handling.md) | This binding directly implements our simplicity and explicit-over-implicit tenets by making errors a first-class concern in the type system instead... |
| [rust-ownership-patterns](./rust-ownership-patterns.md) | This binding implements our simplicity tenet by leveraging Rust's ownership system to prevent entire categories of bugs that would otherwise add tr... |
