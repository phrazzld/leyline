| ID | Summary |
|---|---|
| [api-design](./api-design.md) | This binding directly implements our explicit-over-implicit tenet by ensuring that the contracts between components—the most critical communication... |
| [code-size](./code-size.md) | This binding implements our simplicity tenet by addressing the cognitive overhead created by large, sprawling code units. When functions, methods, ... |
| [dependency-inversion](./dependency-inversion.md) | This binding directly implements our testability tenet by making code inherently more testable through decoupling. When your business logic depends... |
| [dependency-management](./dependency-management.md) | This binding implements our simplicity tenet by addressing a major source of hidden complexity: the sprawling dependency trees that frequently grow... |
| [external-configuration](./external-configuration.md) | This binding directly implements our no-secret-suppression tenet by preventing one of its most dangerous forms: hardcoded secrets and configuration... |
| [go-error-wrapping](./go-error-wrapping.md) | This binding implements our explicit-over-implicit tenet by making error context and propagation paths visible rather than hidden. |
| [hex-domain-purity](./hex-domain-purity.md) | This binding directly implements our simplicity tenet by eliminating a major source of accidental complexity—the entanglement of business rules wit... |
| [immutable-by-default](./immutable-by-default.md) | This binding directly implements our simplicity tenet by eliminating a major source of complexity—unpredictable state changes that are difficult to... |
| [no-internal-mocking](./no-internal-mocking.md) | This binding directly implements our testability tenet by forcing you to design code that's genuinely testable rather than creating the illusion of... |
| [no-lint-suppression](./no-lint-suppression.md) | This binding directly implements our no-secret-suppression tenet by requiring transparency and justification when bypassing automated quality guard... |
| [pure-functions](./pure-functions.md) | This binding implements our simplicity tenet by reducing complexity at its most fundamental level—predictable code execution. When a function is pu... |
| [require-conventional-commits](./require-conventional-commits.md) | This binding directly implements our automation tenet by transforming commit messages from unstructured text into structured data that can drive au... |
| [ts-no-any](./ts-no-any.md) | This binding implements our explicit-over-implicit tenet by requiring you to clearly express types rather than hiding them behind an escape hatch. |
| [use-structured-logging](./use-structured-logging.md) | This binding directly implements our automation tenet by transforming logs from human-readable text into machine-readable data that can power autom... |
