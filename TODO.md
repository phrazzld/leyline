# TODO: Product Prioritization Tenets & Bindings Implementation

## Phase 1: Research & Foundation

### Examine Existing Content for Alignment
- [ ] Read `docs/tenets/simplicity.md` to identify language patterns and concepts to reference
- [ ] Read `docs/tenets/maintainability.md` to identify language patterns and concepts to reference
- [ ] Read `docs/bindings/core/yagni-pattern-enforcement.md` to identify language patterns and concepts to reference
- [ ] Read `docs/templates/tenet_template.md` to understand exact structure requirements
- [ ] Read `docs/templates/binding_template.md` to understand exact structure requirements

### Validate Technical Requirements
- [ ] Read `VERSION` file to get current version number for YAML front-matter
- [ ] Get current date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) for YAML front-matter
- [ ] Confirm YAML front-matter format requirements from existing files

## Phase 2: Content Creation

### Create Product Value First Tenet
- [ ] Create file `docs/tenets/product-value-first.md`
- [ ] Add YAML front-matter with id: `product-value-first`, current date, current version
- [ ] Write title: `# Tenet: Product Value First`
- [ ] Write concise 1-2 sentence principle statement emphasizing code as liability requiring value justification
- [ ] Write Core Belief section (2-4 paragraphs) explaining why code must serve user value over engineering elegance
- [ ] Write first Practical Guideline about evaluating every technical decision against demonstrable user benefit
- [ ] Write second Practical Guideline about distinguishing valuable infrastructure work from overengineering
- [ ] Write third Practical Guideline about prioritizing user-facing value over internal technical preferences
- [ ] Write fourth Practical Guideline about measuring success by user outcomes, not technical metrics
- [ ] Write fifth Practical Guideline about deferring technical work without clear value proposition
- [ ] Write sixth Practical Guideline about questioning every piece of complexity for its value contribution
- [ ] Write first Warning Sign about building elaborate systems for simple problems
- [ ] Write second Warning Sign about prioritizing technical elegance over user needs
- [ ] Write third Warning Sign about extensive refactoring without user-visible improvements
- [ ] Write fourth Warning Sign about complex architectures without demonstrated scale requirements
- [ ] Write fifth Warning Sign about technical decisions driven by resume building rather than user value
- [ ] Write sixth Warning Sign about bikeshedding on technical details while ignoring user feedback
- [ ] Write seventh Warning Sign about justifying work with "best practices" rather than user outcomes
- [ ] Write Related Tenets section with links to simplicity, maintainability, and testability tenets

### Create Value-Driven Prioritization Binding
- [ ] Create file `docs/bindings/core/value-driven-prioritization.md`
- [ ] Add YAML front-matter with id: `value-driven-prioritization`, current date, current version, derived_from: `product-value-first`, enforced_by: `feature specification validation & code review`
- [ ] Write title: `# Binding: Value-Driven Development Prioritization`
- [ ] Write concise rule statement about requiring value justification for all development work
- [ ] Write Rationale section explaining how this binding prevents overengineering and bikeshedding
- [ ] Write Rule Definition section with specific criteria for feature vs. refactoring decisions
- [ ] Add subsection "Value Justification Requirements" with concrete evidence standards
- [ ] Add subsection "Prohibited Development Patterns" listing specific anti-patterns to avoid
- [ ] Add subsection "Evaluation Questions" with decision framework questions
- [ ] Add subsection "Permitted Exceptions" for rare cases where value isn't immediately measurable
- [ ] Write Practical Implementation section with 6 concrete strategies for applying value-driven prioritization
- [ ] Write Examples section with at least 3 code/scenario examples showing good vs. bad prioritization decisions
- [ ] Write Related Bindings section with links to yagni-pattern-enforcement and other relevant bindings

## Phase 3: Integration & Cross-References

### Update Existing Content
- [ ] Add reference to `product-value-first.md` in `docs/tenets/simplicity.md` Related Tenets section
- [ ] Add reference to `value-driven-prioritization.md` in `docs/bindings/core/yagni-pattern-enforcement.md` Related Bindings section
- [ ] Ensure bidirectional linking between new and existing content

### Validate Content with Ruby Tools
- [ ] Run `ruby tools/validate_front_matter.rb` to check YAML compliance
- [ ] Fix any YAML validation errors that occur
- [ ] Run `ruby tools/validate_front_matter.rb -f docs/tenets/product-value-first.md` to validate specific file
- [ ] Run `ruby tools/validate_front_matter.rb -f docs/bindings/core/value-driven-prioritization.md` to validate specific file
- [ ] Run `ruby tools/reindex.rb --strict` to update document indexes
- [ ] Fix any reindex errors that occur
- [ ] Run `ruby tools/fix_cross_references.rb` to ensure link integrity
- [ ] Fix any cross-reference errors that occur

## Phase 4: Final Validation & Cleanup

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Verify both new files follow template structure exactly
- [ ] Verify YAML front-matter matches existing file patterns
- [ ] Verify all cross-references work bidirectionally
- [ ] Verify content addresses issue requirements: bikeshedding, overengineering, value-driven decisions
- [ ] Verify content stays within "size:s" constraint (2 files total)

### Final Tool Validation
- [ ] Run final `ruby tools/validate_front_matter.rb` check on all files
- [ ] Run final `ruby tools/reindex.rb --strict` to ensure indexes are current
- [ ] Run final `ruby tools/fix_cross_references.rb` to ensure all links work

### Documentation & Cleanup
- [ ] Check if `docs/tenets/00-index.md` needs manual updates (likely auto-generated)
- [ ] Check if `docs/bindings/00-index.md` needs manual updates (likely auto-generated)
- [ ] Delete `PLAN-CONTEXT.md` file
- [ ] Delete `PLAN.md` file
- [ ] Delete `TODO.md` file (this file)

## Success Validation

### Technical Validation
- [ ] All Ruby validation tools pass without errors
- [ ] YAML front-matter follows exact standards from existing files
- [ ] Cross-references work in both directions
- [ ] Index files properly include new content

### Content Validation
- [ ] Tenet clearly distinguishes product value from engineering elegance
- [ ] Binding provides actionable decision criteria with specific examples
- [ ] Content specifically addresses bikeshedding and overengineering concerns from issue
- [ ] Related tenets and bindings properly integrated with bidirectional links

### Scope Validation
- [ ] Implementation limited to exactly 2 new files (meets "size:s" constraint)
- [ ] Content focused on product prioritization (meets issue scope)
- [ ] Deliverable provides immediate practical value for development teams
