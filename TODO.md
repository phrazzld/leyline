## Implementation Philosophy

This synthesis applies leyline principles throughout:

**Simplicity Above All:** Tasks are organized with minimal complexity while maintaining completeness. Research phases are consolidated to eliminate redundancy, and validation is strategically placed at key checkpoints rather than scattered throughout.

**Document Decisions:** Each task includes explicit context explaining *why* it exists and *how* it connects to the overall goal. Dependencies are clearly documented to preserve decision rationale.

**Value-Driven Prioritization:** All tasks directly serve the user value of creating comprehensive, actionable testing and QA guidance. No speculative or engineering-driven work is included without clear connection to the binding quality and usability outcomes.
