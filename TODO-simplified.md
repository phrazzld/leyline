# Leyline Implementation TODOs (Simplified)

## Essential Setup
- [x] Create GitHub repository `phrazzld/leyline`
- [ ] Set up basic branch protection (require PRs, no force push)
- [ ] Create v0.1.0 initial tag when ready

## Basic Documentation
- [x] Finalize README.md (already mostly done)
- [x] Set up GitHub Pages for browsable docs

## Integration (Future)
- [ ] Populate example repositories in targets.txt (when ready)
- [ ] Add examples of workflow files for consumers

## Notes
* Initial focus should be on content quality and structure
* Simpler PR process: no mandatory approval requirements initially
* Repository will evolve naturally as usage grows
