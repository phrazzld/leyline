# Observability Analysis Summary

## Key Patterns from Existing Content

### Binding Patterns (use-structured-logging.md & context-propagation.md)
**Implementation Focus**:
- Three pillars of observability: logs, metrics, traces
- Correlation IDs as the connecting thread across all pillars
- JSON structured format for machine readability
- Specific technical requirements (MUST use ISO 8601, W3C Trace Context, etc.)
- AsyncLocalStorage for context management in Node.js
- HTTP headers and message metadata for propagation

**Cross-Reference Pattern**:
- `derived_from` links bindings to parent tenets
- Related Standards section links to complementary bindings
- Focus on how bindings work together

### Tenet Structure (maintainability.md - properly sized example)
**Structure Pattern** (follows tenet_template.md):
1. **YAML Front-matter**: id, last_modified, version
2. **Title**: Clear principle statement (1-2 sentences)
3. **Core Belief**: 2-4 paragraphs explaining the "why" (~150 words)
4. **Practical Guidelines**: 5 actionable items (~150 words)
5. **Warning Signs**: Grouped anti-patterns (~100 words)
6. **Related Tenets**: Cross-references with relationship explanations

**Word Count**: ~400 words total (within 200-400 range)

**Philosophical Focus**:
- Uses analogies (code as written communication)
- Emphasizes "why" over "how"
- Avoids implementation specifics
- Clear separation from bindings

### Cross-Reference Examples (automation.md)
**Pattern**: `[Tenet Name](filename.md): Explanation of relationship`
- Explains how tenets work together or complement each other
- Addresses any tensions and how to balance them
- 2-3 sentences per cross-reference

## Structures for Observability Tenet

### Core Philosophy Elements
From existing content, observability should emphasize:
- **"You can't fix what you can't see"** - fundamental visibility principle
- **Proactive vs reactive** - observability enables getting ahead of problems
- **System self-explanation** - systems must provide their own diagnostic information
- **Three pillars working together** - logs, metrics, traces provide complete picture

### Practical Guidelines (philosophical, not implementation)
1. **Design for visibility from day one** - don't bolt on observability later
2. **Implement comprehensive correlation** - connect related events across system boundaries
3. **Make signals actionable, not noisy** - quality over quantity in monitoring
4. **Instrument business logic, not just infrastructure** - track what matters to users
5. **Plan for debugging distributed systems** - anticipate complexity of modern architectures

### Warning Signs (anti-patterns)
- **Silent failures** - errors that don't surface until users complain
- **Alert fatigue** - too many false positives reducing response effectiveness
- **Debugging by guesswork** - lack of data forcing speculation about problems
- **Reactive incident response** - only learning about issues from user reports
- **Correlation gaps** - inability to trace requests across service boundaries
- **Visibility blind spots** - critical system components that provide no diagnostic information

### Related Tenets for Cross-Reference
**Direct relationships**:
- **Automation**: Observability enables automated monitoring and alerting
- **Testability**: Observable systems are easier to test and validate
- **Maintainability**: Visibility into system behavior improves maintenance
- **Explicit over Implicit**: Making system behavior visible and explicit

**Future tenets** (placeholders):
- **Reliability** (when created): Observability is prerequisite for reliable systems
- **Incident Response** (when created): Effective incident response requires observability

### Content Separation Strategy
**Tenet (philosophical)**: Why observability matters, principles for thinking about visibility
**Bindings (implementation)**: How to implement observability (existing structured-logging binding)

**Clear boundary**: Tenet focuses on decision-making principles, bindings provide technical specifics

## Implementation Notes

### Word Count Target
- **Core Belief**: ~150 words
- **Practical Guidelines**: ~150 words
- **Warning Signs**: ~100 words
- **Total**: ~400 words (within 200-400 range)

### Cross-Reference Strategy
- Link to existing automation, testability, maintainability tenets
- Reference structured-logging binding for implementation
- Create placeholder references for future reliability/incident-response tenets

### Validation Checks
- YAML front-matter validation with validate_front_matter.rb
- Template structure compliance with tenet_template.md
- Word count verification
- Cross-reference link validation
