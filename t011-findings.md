# T011 Findings: Refactor identified tooling for YAML-only

## Overview
This document summarizes the findings and actions for task T011, which aimed to refactor any additional tools identified in T010 that use legacy metadata parsing.

## Findings

Based on the comprehensive search conducted in task T010 (documented in `legacy_metadata_search_results.md`):

1. **No additional tooling identified for refactoring**
   - All tools that interact with metadata have already been refactored in previous tasks
   - Core tools (`validate_front_matter.rb`, `reindex.rb`) have been updated to YAML-only
   - Test files have been updated to use YAML-only format
   - CI configuration has no legacy-specific elements

2. **Single remaining file with legacy format handling**
   - `tenet_metadata_migration.rb` still contains logic for parsing legacy format
   - This script was specifically created for the migration process
   - It is not part of regular tooling and is expected to be archived or removed
   - This file will be handled in task T016 (Repository cleanup) rather than this task

## Actions Taken

Since no additional tooling requiring refactoring was identified, no code changes were needed for this task. The actions taken were:

1. Reviewed the findings from task T010
2. Confirmed that all regular tools have already been refactored to YAML-only
3. Documented the status in this file
4. Noted that `tenet_metadata_migration.rb` will be addressed in task T016

## Conclusion

Task T011 is considered complete as it was conditional on finding tools that needed refactoring, and no such tools were identified. The codebase has been successfully transitioned to YAML-only format for all regular operations.

The migration script (`tenet_metadata_migration.rb`) will be addressed in task T016 as part of the repository cleanup process.
