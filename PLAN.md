# Implementation Plan: Semantic Versioning and Release Automation

## Executive Summary

Implement a comprehensive semantic versioning and release automation system for Leyline that enables safe consumer adoption and migration. This plan prioritizes simplicity, automation, and practical consumer value while building on existing foundations (conventional commits, Ruby tooling).

## Technical Approach Analysis

### Approach Evaluation

**Considered Approaches:**

1. **GitHub Actions + semantic-release (Node.js)**
   - *Pros:* Mature ecosystem, extensive features, wide adoption
   - *Cons:* Introduces Node.js to Ruby project, potential tooling conflicts, overengineered for documentation repo
   - *Philosophy Alignment:* Violates "Simplicity First" - adds unnecessary complexity

2. **Pure Ruby solution with custom tooling**
   - *Pros:* Aligns with existing tooling, full control, minimal dependencies
   - *Cons:* Requires significant custom development, reinvents existing solutions
   - *Philosophy Alignment:* Violates "Don't Repeat Yourself" - changelog generation is solved

3. **Hybrid GitHub Actions + minimal tooling** ⭐ **SELECTED**
   - *Pros:* Simple, builds on existing foundations, practical, maintainable
   - *Cons:* Some custom scripting required
   - *Philosophy Alignment:* ✅ Simplicity First, ✅ Automation, ✅ Pragmatic

### Selected Architecture

**Core Components:**
1. **Version Determination Engine** - Analyzes conventional commits to determine semantic version bumps
2. **Release Orchestrator** - GitHub Actions workflow managing the release process
3. **Documentation Generator** - Creates changelog and migration guides
4. **Consumer Integration Testing** - Validates releases against sample consumers
5. **Rollback System** - Procedures and tooling for safe release rollbacks

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Version Determination)

**Objective:** Establish semantic version calculation based on conventional commits

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Create version calculation script** (`tools/calculate_version.rb`)
   - Parse git history since last release
   - Analyze conventional commit types (feat, fix, BREAKING CHANGE)
   - Calculate next semantic version (patch/minor/major)
   - Output: JSON with current version, next version, change type

2. **Integrate with existing Ruby tools**
   - Extend `tools/validate_front_matter.rb` to validate version fields
   - Update `tools/reindex.rb` to include version metadata
   - Ensure version consistency across all documentation

3. **Create release preparation script** (`tools/prepare_release.rb`)

    A[Conventional Commit] --> B[Version Calculation]
    B --> C[Changelog Generation]
    C --> D[Release Validation]
    D --> E[Git Tag Creation]

    I -->|No| J[Rollback Procedure]
    I -->|Yes| K[Release Complete]
```

### Module Interfaces

**Version Calculator Interface:**
```ruby
class VersionCalculator
  def initialize(repository_path, current_version)
  def calculate_next_version() # returns { current: "1.0.0", next: "1.1.0", type: "minor" }
  def generate_changelog(since_version) # returns structured changelog
  def validate_version_consistency() # validates all docs have consistent versions
end
```

**Release Orchestrator Interface:**
```yaml
# GitHub Actions Workflow Inputs
inputs:
  dry_run: boolean
  force_version: string
  skip_validation: boolean

# Outputs
outputs:
  version: string
  changelog: string
  release_url: string
```

### Security Considerations

1. **Secret Management**
   - GitHub token for release API access
   - No hardcoded credentials in scripts or workflows
   - Minimal permission scopes for automation

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all commit message parsing
   - Sanitize changelog content for injection attacks
   - Verify Git tag format and constraints

3. **Access Control**
   - Release workflow only triggers on main branch
   - Require PR reviews for release configuration changes
   - Protected branch rules enforce quality gates

### Configuration Management

**External Configuration Points:**
- `VERSION` file for current version tracking
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` for workflow configuration
- `examples/` directory for consumer integration examples
- Environment variables for GitHub API access

**No Hardcoded Values:**
- Release workflow parameters configurable
- Version calculation rules externalized
- Consumer examples templated

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (tools/test_*)
- Version calculation logic with edge cases
- Changelog generation with various commit patterns
- Ruby tool integration points
- Error handling and validation

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end release workflow in development
- Consumer integration validation
- Documentation consistency checks
- GitHub API integration

### System Testing
- Full release cycle with sample consumer
- Rollback procedure validation
- Multi-version upgrade scenarios
- Performance under large commit histories

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Failed Release Deployment** | High | Medium | Comprehensive pre-release validation, rollback automation |
| **Consumer Breaking Changes** | High | Low | Migration guide generation, version compatibility testing |
| **Git History Corruption** | Medium | Low | Git tag validation, backup procedures |
| **Automation Failure** | Medium | Medium | Manual fallback procedures, monitoring |
| **Version Calculation Errors** | Medium | Low | Extensive unit testing, validation checks |
| **Consumer Integration Issues** | Medium | Medium | Sample consumer testing, documentation |

## Open Questions and Assumptions

### Questions Requiring Resolution:
1. **Initial Version**: What should be the first semantic version? (Suggest: 1.0.0)
2. **Breaking Change Policy**: How to define breaking changes for documentation? (Suggest: Removed/renamed tenets/bindings)
3. **Release Frequency**: Automated on every merge or scheduled? (Suggest: Every merge to main)
4. **Consumer Notification**: How to notify consumers of new releases? (Suggest: GitHub releases + optional webhook)

### Assumptions:
- Conventional commits are already enforced and reliable
- Ruby tooling environment is stable and preferred
- GitHub Actions is available and preferred CI/CD platform
- Consumers primarily integrate via Git submodules or direct file copying
