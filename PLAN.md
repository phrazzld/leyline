# Implementation Plan: Product Prioritization Tenets & Bindings

## Executive Summary

This plan implements Issue #51 by creating a focused tenet and binding that establish principles around product-value-driven development decisions. The approach emphasizes that code must justify its existence through user value, directly addressing the issue's concern about avoiding overengineering and bikeshedding.

## Architecture Analysis

### Approach Selection

After analyzing multiple approaches, I've selected **Option A: Single Tenet + Core Binding** because it:

- **Aligns with scope**: Meets the "size:s" constraint while delivering high-impact guidance
- **Leverages existing philosophy**: Builds on established simplicity and YAGNI principles
- **Addresses root cause**: Targets the fundamental issue of value-driven vs. technology-driven decisions
- **Enables broad application**: Core binding applies universally across all technology stacks

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Multiple Tenets Approach**: Would create separate tenets for "Product Value First" and "Avoid Technical Bikeshedding"
   - *Rejected*: Exceeds size constraint, creates potential overlap with existing simplicity tenet

2. **Category-Specific Bindings**: Would create frontend/backend/etc. specific implementations
   - *Rejected*: Higher complexity, smaller immediate impact than universal core binding

3. **Extend Existing Simplicity Tenet**: Would add product-value guidance to existing tenet
   - *Rejected*: Dilutes focus of well-established tenet, harder to reference specifically

## Technical Architecture

### File Structure
```
docs/
├── tenets/
│   └── product-value-first.md          # NEW: Core tenet
└── bindings/
    └── core/
        └── value-driven-prioritization.md  # NEW: Universal binding
```

### Content Architecture

#### Tenet: Product Value First
- **Core Philosophy**: Code exists to serve user value, not engineering elegance
- **Key Principle**: Every line of code must justify its existence through demonstrable user benefit
- **Scope**: Foundational principle that guides all technical decisions

#### Binding: Value-Driven Prioritization
- **Rule Focus**: Enforceable criteria for feature and refactoring decisions
- **Evidence Standards**: Concrete requirements for justifying technical work
- **Process Integration**: Clear decision framework for development priorities

### Cross-Reference Strategy

The new tenet will integrate with existing principles:
- **Primary relationship**: Extends and specializes the simplicity tenet
- **Supporting relationships**: References maintainability, testability, and YAGNI principles
- **Bidirectional links**: Update related tenets to reference new product-value principle

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Research & Validation (5 min)
1. **Examine existing cross-references**
   - Read current simplicity and maintainability tenets for alignment opportunities
   - Identify specific language and concepts to reference consistently

2. **Validate current VERSION file**
   - Confirm current version for YAML front-matter consistency
   - Check DATE format requirements

### Phase 2: Content Creation (15 min)
3. **Draft Product Value First tenet**
   - Follow established template structure
   - Emphasize that code is a liability requiring value justification
   - Include concrete guidelines for evaluating technical decisions against user value
   - Address common misconceptions about infrastructure work vs. overengineering

4. **Draft Value-Driven Prioritization binding**
   - Define specific criteria for feature vs. refactoring decisions
   - Establish evidence requirements for technical debt work
   - Provide concrete examples of value-driven vs. technology-driven choices
   - Include decision framework with clear evaluation questions

### Phase 3: Integration & Validation (10 min)
5. **Add cross-references to existing content**
   - Update simplicity tenet to reference new product-value principle
   - Update YAGNI binding to reference value-driven prioritization
   - Ensure bidirectional linking for discoverability

6. **Validate with Ruby tools**
   - Run `ruby tools/validate_front_matter.rb` for YAML compliance
   - Run `ruby tools/reindex.rb --strict` to update indexes
   - Run `ruby tools/fix_cross_references.rb` to ensure link integrity

### Phase 4: Documentation & Cleanup (5 min)
7. **Update any index files** if needed
8. **Remove planning artifacts** (PLAN-CONTEXT.md, PLAN.md)

## Testing Strategy

### Validation Layers
1. **YAML Front-matter**: Automated validation via `validate_front_matter.rb`
2. **Cross-references**: Link integrity via `fix_cross_references.rb`
3. **Index Integration**: Document discovery via `reindex.rb`
4. **Content Quality**: Manual review of template compliance

### Coverage Approach
- **Minimal dependencies**: New files only depend on existing, stable content
- **Template compliance**: Both files follow established patterns exactly
- **Cross-reference coverage**: 95%+ of related tenets properly linked

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| YAML validation failure | Medium | Follow exact template format, validate early |
| Cross-reference conflicts | Low | Use existing reference patterns, automated checking |
| Content overlap with simplicity | Medium | Focus on product value specialization, clear differentiation |
| Scope creep beyond "small size" | High | Strict adherence to 2-file limit, focused content |

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] All Ruby validation tools pass without errors
- [ ] YAML front-matter follows exact standards
- [ ] Cross-references work bidirectionally
- [ ] Index files properly include new content

### Content Success
- [ ] Tenet clearly distinguishes product value from engineering elegance
- [ ] Binding provides actionable decision criteria
- [ ] Content addresses bikeshedding and overengineering specifically
- [ ] Related tenets properly integrated

### Process Success
- [ ] Implementation stays within "size:s" constraint
- [ ] Delivery timeline matches "priority:high" expectation
- [ ] Content serves immediate practical value for development teams

## Open Questions

1. **Tenet naming**: "Product Value First" vs. "Code Serves Users" vs. "Value-Driven Development"?
   - *Recommendation*: "Product Value First" - direct, action-oriented, clear priority

2. **Binding enforcement level**: Should this be enforced via code review, feature specification, or both?
   - *Recommendation*: Both - feature specification validation AND code review criteria

3. **Infrastructure work guidance**: How detailed should guidance be for distinguishing valuable infrastructure work from overengineering?
   - *Recommendation*: Provide concrete examples but keep principles general enough to apply broadly

## Delivery Timeline

- **Total estimated time**: 35 minutes
- **Critical path**: Content creation → YAML validation → Cross-reference integration
- **Risk buffer**: 10 minutes for unexpected validation issues or content refinement

This plan delivers focused, high-impact guidance on product-value-driven development decisions while maintaining the simplicity and clarity that characterizes the leyline project.
