# Future Work: Leyline Document Enhancement

Based on the comprehensive audit conducted in T037, this document outlines the needed additions and enhancements to the Leyline documentation ecosystem. These items have been converted into specific tasks in the TODO.md file and will be implemented in future phases.

## Core Philosophy Gaps

The audit identified several core areas where additional bindings are needed to fully cover the principles outlined in DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md:

1. **API Design (T041)**
   - Current coverage: Partial, aspects in explicit-over-implicit tenet
   - Need: Dedicated binding for defining clear, explicit contracts for all APIs
   - Scope: Internal module interfaces, external REST/gRPC/GraphQL APIs, and CLIs
   - Parent tenet: Explicit over Implicit

2. **Pure Functions (T042)**
   - Current coverage: Partial, aspects in hex-domain-purity binding
   - Need: Dedicated binding for implementing core logic as pure functions
   - Scope: Definition, benefits, implementation patterns for functional approach
   - Parent tenets: Simplicity, Testability

3. **Dependency Management (T043)**
   - Current coverage: Missing
   - Need: Guidance on minimizing and maintaining third-party dependencies
   - Scope: Evaluation criteria, security auditing, maintenance strategies
   - Parent tenets: Simplicity, Automation

4. **Code Size (T044)**
   - Current coverage: Missing
   - Need: Clear guidelines on appropriate function, method, and file lengths
   - Scope: Measurable criteria, refactoring signals, implementation
   - Parent tenets: Simplicity, Modularity

5. **Observability (T045)**
   - Current coverage: Partial, only structured logging covered
   - Need: Enhancement of existing logging binding to include all observability pillars
   - Scope: Metrics collection, distributed tracing
   - Parent tenets: Explicit over Implicit, Maintainability

## Language-Specific Gaps

The audit revealed significant gaps in language-specific guidance, which need to be addressed to provide complete coverage of the language appendices:

### Go-Specific Gaps (T046-T048)

1. **Package Design (T046)**
   - Need: Guidance on Go-specific package organization, naming, and structure
   - Alignment: Go Appendix Section 4

2. **Interface Design (T047)**
   - Need: Best practices for Go interface design (small interfaces, consumer-defined)
   - Alignment: Go Appendix Section 7

3. **Concurrency Patterns (T048)**
   - Need: Guidelines for safe, effective concurrency in Go
   - Alignment: Go Appendix Section 9

### TypeScript-Specific Gaps (T049-T050)

1. **Module Organization (T049)**
   - Need: TypeScript-specific module, import/export, and project organization
   - Alignment: TypeScript Appendix Section 6

2. **Async Patterns (T050)**
   - Need: TypeScript async/await patterns and error handling
   - Alignment: TypeScript Appendix Sections 8 and 9

### Rust-Specific Gaps (T051-T052)

1. **Ownership Patterns (T051)**
   - Need: Rust-specific ownership, borrowing, and lifetime patterns
   - Alignment: Rust Appendix Section 7

2. **Error Handling (T052)**
   - Need: Rust-specific error handling patterns (Result, Option, error types)
   - Alignment: Rust Appendix Section 8

### Frontend-Specific Gaps (T053-T055)

The Frontend Appendix has no coverage at all in the current bindings, requiring several new bindings:

1. **Component Architecture (T053)**
   - Need: Atomic Design principles for component organization
   - Alignment: Frontend Appendix Section 1

2. **State Management (T054)**
   - Need: Approaches and best practices for frontend state management
   - Alignment: Frontend Appendix Section 5

3. **Accessibility (T055)**
   - Need: Requirements and implementation for web accessibility (a11y)
   - Alignment: Frontend Appendix Section 7

## Implementation Priority

The tasks have been prioritized as P3 (lower priority than current work) and will be implemented after the completion of current documentation and testing tasks. Within this future work, the suggested implementation order is:

1. **Core bindings first** (T041-T045) to complete coverage of the primary development philosophy
2. **Go bindings** (T046-T048) as this appears to be a primary language in use
3. **TypeScript bindings** (T049-T050) 
4. **Frontend bindings** (T053-T055) to support web application development
5. **Rust bindings** (T051-T052) to complete coverage

## Integration with Existing Documentation

All new bindings will:
1. Follow the established natural language template and style guide
2. Link appropriately to related tenets and bindings
3. Be indexed properly in the binding index
4. Include practical examples aligned with the natural language approach

## Conclusion

Implementing these 15 new bindings will significantly enhance the coverage and utility of the Leyline documentation ecosystem, ensuring comprehensive guidance across all aspects of the development philosophy and all supported programming languages and paradigms. These documents will continue the "natural language first" approach to ensure they work effectively for both human readers and as context for large language models.
