## Validation Process

The validation process consisted of running the `tools/validate_front_matter.rb` script
against all tenet files to verify that each file:

- Contains valid front-matter structure
- Includes all required fields
- Uses the correct format for dates, IDs, and other fields

## Results

All files passed validation with no issues. No modifications were required.

## Conclusion

The rewritten tenets are compliant with the required format standards and are ready for
the next phase of the project. This confirms that the tenet rewrite process has
successfully maintained the required structural integrity while implementing the natural
language approach.
