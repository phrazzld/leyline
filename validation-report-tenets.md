# Validation Report: Rewritten Tenets

## Summary
Validation of all rewritten tenet files has been performed using the front-matter validation tool (`tools/validate_front_matter.rb`). All tenet files have passed validation successfully with no errors or issues detected.

## Validated Files
The following tenet files have been successfully validated:

1. tenets/simplicity.md (T010)
2. tenets/modularity.md (T011)
3. tenets/testability.md (T012)
4. tenets/maintainability.md (T013)
5. tenets/explicit-over-implicit.md (T014)
6. tenets/automation.md (T015)
7. tenets/document-decisions.md (T016)
8. tenets/no-secret-suppression.md (T017)

## Validation Process
The validation process consisted of running the `tools/validate_front_matter.rb` script against all tenet files to verify that each file:
- Contains valid front-matter structure
- Includes all required fields
- Uses the correct format for dates, IDs, and other fields

## Results
All files passed validation with no issues. No modifications were required.

## Conclusion
The rewritten tenets are compliant with the required format standards and are ready for the next phase of the project. This confirms that the tenet rewrite process has successfully maintained the required structural integrity while implementing the natural language approach.
