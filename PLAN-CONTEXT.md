## Issue Details
**Issue #17: Feature: Incorporate Top Tier Pragmatic Programming Principles**
- URL: https://github.com/phrazzld/leyline/issues/17
- Priority: High
- Type: Feature
- Size: Medium
- Complexity: Medium

## Overview
Incorporate top tier pragmatic programming principles from established best practices in software development to enhance the Leyline philosophy and binding documentation.

## Requirements
- [ ] Research and identify key pragmatic programming principles from authoritative sources
- [ ] Evaluate which principles align with and enhance the existing Leyline philosophy
- [ ] Create new tenets or extend existing ones to incorporate these principles
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect these additions
- [ ] Ensure principles are consistently applied across all binding categories

## Technical Context
- Current Leyline philosophy is built around 8 core tenets: automation, document-decisions, explicit-over-implicit, maintainability, modularity, no-secret-suppression, simplicity, testability
- Existing binding structure in docs/bindings/core/ and docs/bindings/categories/
- YAML front-matter validation system in place
- Ruby tools for validation, indexing, and cross-reference management
- Need to maintain consistency with existing tenet and binding formats

## Related Issues
- None specified (no dependencies listed)

## Authoritative Sources to Consider
- "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt
- "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin
- "Code Complete" by Steve McConnell
- Industry best practices from major engineering organizations
- Modern software engineering principles from recent thought leaders
