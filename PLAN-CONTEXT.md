# Task Description

## Issue Details
- **Issue #77**: feat: add Database binding category
- **URL**: https://github.com/phaedrus-sg/leyline/issues/77
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Feature
- **Size**: Large

## Overview
Create Database binding category to address critical gap in data persistence patterns. Database interactions are fundamental to most applications, yet Leyline lacks database-specific bindings. This category would provide essential patterns for data persistence, migrations, and query optimization.

## Requirements

### Core Database Operations
- **migration-management-strategy.md** - Database schema evolution patterns
- **orm-usage-patterns.md** - Object-relational mapping best practices
- **query-optimization-and-indexing.md** - Performance optimization guidelines
- **connection-pooling-standards.md** - Resource management patterns
- **transaction-management-patterns.md** - ACID compliance and error handling

### Advanced Patterns
- **data-validation-at-boundaries.md** - Input sanitization and validation
- **database-testing-strategies.md** - Testing with databases
- **read-replica-patterns.md** - Scaling read operations
- **audit-logging-implementation.md** - Change tracking patterns

## Technical Context
- Create docs/bindings/categories/database/ directory
- Implement at least 5 core database bindings
- Cover both SQL and NoSQL patterns where applicable
- Include practical examples for common scenarios
- Derive all bindings from existing tenets
- Pass validation checks

## Related Issues
This appears to be part of the broader content expansion effort, potentially related to issue #63 (comprehensive tenet and binding expansion) and other category creation issues.
