# Task Description

## Issue Details

**Issue #51**: "write new tenets / bindings for product prioritization"
**URL**: https://github.com/phrazzld/leyline/issues/51
**Priority**: High
**Type**: Feature
**Size**: Small

## Overview

Create new tenets and/or bindings that establish principles around product prioritization, emphasizing that code is a liability whose purpose is to serve compelling, useful, delightful product experiences and create value in people's lives.

## Requirements

From the issue description:
- Code should serve the end goal of compelling, useful, delightful product experiences
- All code should create value in people's lives
- Infrastructure and hard engineering work can serve this purpose by making codebases easier to work on (faster value generation) and more stable (accessible value)
- Must avoid refactors, design decisions, etc. that are bikeshedding and thumb twiddling that do not make the product better
- Must avoid overengineering and writing code for the sake of writing code

## Technical Context

- Leyline uses standardized YAML front-matter for all tenet and binding files
- Tenets are high-level principles located in `docs/tenets/`
- Bindings are enforceable rules in `docs/bindings/core/` (universal) or `docs/bindings/categories/<tech>/`
- Strong emphasis on simplicity, YAGNI principles, and avoiding overengineering in existing philosophy
- Current VERSION is '0.1.0'

## Related Issues

This relates to the broader theme of engineering excellence while avoiding complexity for its own sake, connecting to existing tenets around simplicity and YAGNI principles.
