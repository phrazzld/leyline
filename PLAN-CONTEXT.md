# Task Description

## Issue Details
**Issue #87: Add TypeScript-specific bindings**
- **URL**: https://github.com/phrazzld/leyline/issues/87
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Labels**: priority:critical

## Overview
Create TypeScript category bindings that reflect observed patterns and modern best practices.

## Requirements
The issue specifies creating the following TypeScript bindings:
- Vitest as the preferred testing framework
- tsup for library builds and bundling
- Require packageManager and engines fields in package.json
- TanStack Query for server state management
- Standard ESLint + Prettier setup

## Technical Context
- **Location**: New bindings should be created in `docs/bindings/categories/typescript/`
- **Existing TypeScript bindings**: Currently 7 existing bindings focused on code patterns and quality
- **Dependencies**: Depends on core toolchain bindings being established
- **YAML front-matter**: All bindings must include standardized metadata

## Related Issues
- **Dependency**: Core toolchain bindings need to be established first
- **Part of broader initiative**: Adding technology-specific bindings across multiple languages

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Each binding includes rationale tied to tenets
- [ ] Provide concrete configuration examples
- [ ] Include enforcement mechanisms (lint rules, CI checks)
- [ ] Reference observed usage patterns from repository analysis
- [ ] Pass validation checks using `ruby tools/validate_front_matter.rb`
