|---|---|
| [automation](./automation.md) | Automation is fundamentally about respecting the scarcity of human attention and creativity. When you automate repetitive tasks, you're making a st... |
| [document-decisions](./document-decisions.md) | Software development is fundamentally a decision-making process. Each line of code represents a series of choices—about algorithms, data structures... |
| [explicit-over-implicit](./explicit-over-implicit.md) | Software development is fundamentally about managing complexity, and explicitness is one of our most powerful tools for doing so. When code is expl... |
| [maintainability](./maintainability.md) | Most of a software project's lifetime is spent in maintenance mode. The code you write today will be read, modified, and debugged dozens or hundred... |
| [modularity](./modularity.md) | Modularity is the fundamental approach for taming complexity in software systems. When you design your code as a collection of well-defined, indepe... |
| [no-secret-suppression](./no-secret-suppression.md) | Software quality tools—linters, type checkers, test suites, security scanners—represent your first and most reliable line of defense against defect... |
| [simplicity](./simplicity.md) | Simplicity is a fundamental requirement for building high-quality, maintainable software, not just a nice-to-have goal. When you write simple code,... |
| [testability](./testability.md) | Testable code is inherently better code. When you design your systems with testability in mind, you're not just making testing easier—you're creati... |
