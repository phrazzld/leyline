# T032 Plan: Perform Peer Review of Rewritten Bindings

## Task Analysis
- Conduct peer reviews for all rewritten binding files (T021-T030)
- Focus on clarity, style guide adherence, philosophical alignment, and correct linking
- Incorporate feedback to improve the binding documents
- Document the review process and results

## Current State Assessment
- All bindings T021-T030 have been rewritten
- Need to ensure consistency, clarity, and adherence to the natural language style guide
- Need to verify philosophical alignment with corresponding tenets
- Need to ensure correct linking between related bindings

## Implementation Steps
1. Retrieve the style guide and templates for reference
2. Create a review rubric based on key criteria:
   - Clarity and accessibility of language
   - Natural language style adherence
   - Philosophical alignment with parent tenets
   - Proper use of analogies
   - Correct linking between related bindings
   - Consistent structure following the template
3. Review each binding systematically:
   - dependency-inversion.md
   - external-configuration.md
   - go-error-wrapping.md
   - hex-domain-purity.md
   - immutable-by-default.md
   - no-internal-mocking.md
   - no-lint-suppression.md
   - require-conventional-commits.md
   - ts-no-any.md
   - use-structured-logging.md
4. Document findings and feedback for each binding
5. Make necessary revisions to address issues identified
6. Create a summary of the review process and improvements made
7. Update TODO.md to mark task as complete
8. Commit changes

## Success Criteria
- All binding files have been thoroughly reviewed
- Identified issues are documented and addressed
- Review follows the established criteria
- Changes are properly committed
- TODO.md is updated to reflect task completion
