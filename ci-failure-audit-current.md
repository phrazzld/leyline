# CI Failure Audit for Current PR: Natural Language Rewrites of Tenets and Bindings

## Overview

The CI for the "Natural Language Rewrites of Tenets and Bindings" PR is currently failing. This document provides an updated analysis of the failures and their status as of May 8, 2025.

## Failed Jobs

Based on the most recent CI run (14871966093), two jobs are failing:

1. **lint-docs** - Failed at the "Format + link check" step
2. **deploy** (GitHub Pages workflow) - Failed

## Detailed Analysis

### lint-docs Failure

The `lint-docs` job failed specifically in the "Format + link check" step. This indicates:
- There may be inconsistent markdown formatting across files
- There could be broken internal links between documents
- The front-matter YAML might have formatting issues

### deploy Failure (GitHub Pages)

The GitHub Pages deployment is failing, likely due to:
- Build errors in MkDocs
- Invalid cross-references between documents
- Path issues in the documentation structure

## Status of Fixes

From the existing ci-failure-audit-current.md file, we see that tasks have been defined to address these exact issues:

### T060: Fix broken links causing MkDocs build failure (Not completed)

This task is designed to address the **deploy** job failure by:

- Fixing relative links in index.md that use the ./docs/ prefix
- Updating link to examples/github-workflows/language-specific-sync.yml
- Verifying all links use correct paths in the docs structure

### T061: Apply consistent markdown formatting (Not completed)

This task is designed to address the **lint-docs** job failure by:

- Installing mdformat locally
- Running mdformat on all markdown files
- Committing the formatting changes

## Recommended Action

The CI failures match exactly with the pending tasks T060 and T061. Since these tasks are already defined with clear steps to resolve the issues, we should:

1. Complete task T060 to fix the broken links causing the deploy job to fail
2. Complete task T061 to apply consistent markdown formatting to all files
3. After completing these tasks, commit the changes and push to the branch
4. Verify that the CI passes with the new changes

These tasks are marked as P0 (highest priority) in the TODO.md file, indicating they should be completed immediately to unblock the CI pipeline.

## Next Steps

After resolving the immediate CI failures, task T062 (Add markdown formatting pre-commit hook) should be completed to prevent similar formatting issues in the future.

## Verification Needed

Before proceeding with fixes, it would be helpful to:
1. Run the markdown linter locally to pinpoint specific formatting issues
2. Check the MkDocs build locally to identify specific broken links
