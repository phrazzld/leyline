## Review Template

For each binding, we'll document:

1. **Overall Assessment**: Brief summary of strengths and areas for improvement
2. **Specific Feedback**: Detailed feedback organized by the criteria above
3. **Required Changes**: List of specific changes needed to address issues
4. **Optional Suggestions**: Additional suggestions for improvement that are not critical

## Scoring System

For each criterion, we'll use the following scoring:

- **✅ Excellent**: Exceeds expectations, could serve as an example for others
- **✓ Good**: Meets expectations, no significant issues
- **⚠️ Needs Improvement**: Some issues that should be addressed
- **❌ Significant Issues**: Major problems that must be fixed

## Review Process

1. Read the complete binding document
2. Score each criterion
3. Document specific feedback and suggestions
4. Implement required changes
5. Verify changes address the identified issues
