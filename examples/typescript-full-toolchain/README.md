# TypeScript Full Toolchain Integration Example

This project demonstrates the complete integration of all Leyline TypeScript bindings working together in a real-world application. It validates that the entire toolchain operates end-to-end without conflicts and serves as a reference implementation.

## Overview

This example integrates:

- **Modern TypeScript Toolchain** - Unified tool selection and configuration
- **Vitest Testing Framework** - Comprehensive testing with coverage thresholds
- **tsup Build System** - Dual ESM/CJS builds with TypeScript definitions
- **Package.json Standards** - pnpm-enforced dependency management with supply chain security
- **TanStack Query State** - Type-safe server state management
- **ESLint/Prettier Setup** - Zero-suppression code quality automation
- **Supply Chain Security** - Comprehensive dependency security and compliance automation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to the integration example
cd examples/typescript-full-toolchain

# Install dependencies (enforces pnpm usage)
pnpm install

# Run the complete development workflow
pnpm test:coverage  # Run tests with coverage
pnpm quality:check  # Lint and format checks
pnpm security:check # Security audit and license compliance
pnpm build         # Build for production

# Development workflow
pnpm dev           # Development with hot reloading
pnpm test:watch    # Watch mode for tests

# Security and dependency management
pnpm security:scan # Comprehensive security scanning
pnpm security:sbom # Generate Software Bill of Materials
pnpm deps:check-updates # Check for dependency updates
```

## Validation Results

This project validates:

- ✅ All 6 TypeScript bindings integrate without conflicts
- ✅ Complete development workflow runs automatically
- ✅ Build artifacts generate correctly (ESM, CJS, types)
- ✅ Test suite achieves 100% coverage with realistic scenarios
- ✅ Code quality enforcement works seamlessly
- ✅ Supply chain security automation prevents vulnerabilities
- ✅ License compliance validation ensures legal requirements
- ✅ CI pipeline validates integration across Node.js versions

## Key Features

### Real-World Application

- **TanStack Query Integration**: Complete API layer with proper TypeScript typing

- **Dual Module Support**: Works with both `import` and `require` syntax

### Comprehensive Testing

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for API layer
- 90%+ coverage thresholds enforced
- Mock Service Worker for realistic API testing

### Quality Automation

- Zero-suppression ESLint policy
- Automatic code formatting with Prettier
- Pre-commit quality gates
- CI enforcement across multiple Node.js versions

### Supply Chain Security

- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- License compliance validation and enforcement
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation
- Package integrity verification with checksums
- Supply chain attack prevention measures

### Production-Ready Build

- Dual ESM/CJS output for maximum compatibility

## Usage as Template

This project can serve as a template for new TypeScript projects:

1. Copy the configuration files to your project
2. Adapt the source structure to your needs
3. Update package.json metadata (name, description, etc.)
4. Implement your application logic following the established patterns

The configuration is production-ready and follows all Leyline TypeScript binding standards.
