# Supply Chain Security: TypeScript Full Toolchain

This document demonstrates comprehensive supply chain security practices implemented in the TypeScript Full Toolchain example project, serving as a reference for secure dependency management in production TypeScript applications.

## Overview

The TypeScript Full Toolchain implements defense-in-depth supply chain security through multiple layers:

1. **Dependency Integrity**: Automated verification of package checksums and signatures
2. **Vulnerability Monitoring**: Continuous scanning for known security issues
3. **License Compliance**: Automated validation of dependency licenses
4. **Version Control**: Strategic pinning and semantic versioning for security
5. **Provenance Verification**: Supply chain attack prevention measures

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Automated Security Scanning

The project includes comprehensive security scanning through multiple npm scripts:

```bash
# Core security checks (run these regularly)
pnpm run security:check          # Combined audit and license check
pnpm run security:audit          # Dependency vulnerability scanning
pnpm run security:licenses       # License compliance validation

# Advanced security tools
pnpm run security:scan           # Comprehensive security scan with local script
pnpm run security:sbom           # Generate Software Bill of Materials

# Dependency management
pnpm run deps:check-updates      # Check for available updates
pnpm run deps:update             # Interactive dependency updates
pnpm run install:verify          # Verify installation integrity
```

### 2. Package Integrity Verification

#### Lockfile Integrity
- **pnpm-lock.yaml**: Cryptographic hashes ensure reproducible installations
- **Integrity Checks**: `verify-store-integrity=true` in .npmrc
- **Frozen Installs**: CI uses `--frozen-lockfile` to prevent tampering

#### Checksum Validation
```bash
# Verify package checksums during installation
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --verify-store-integrity --check-files

# Validate signature authenticity where available
npm audit signatures
```

### 3. Version Strategy for Security

The project implements a tiered versioning approach:

#### Security-Critical Dependencies (Exact Pinning)
For authentication, encryption, or core security libraries:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@tanstack/query-core": "5.45.1"  // Exact version for server state management
  }
}
```

#### Non-Critical Dependencies (Semantic Ranges)
For development tools and non-security-sensitive packages:
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.4.5",           // Allows patch and minor updates
    "vitest": "^1.6.0",               // Testing framework updates
    "prettier": "^3.3.2"              // Code formatting tool updates
  }
}
```

**Rationale**: Exact pinning for security-critical dependencies ensures that security audits remain valid and prevents automatic updates that could introduce vulnerabilities. Semantic ranges for development tools allow beneficial updates while maintaining compatibility.

### 4. License Compliance Automation

Automated license validation ensures all dependencies meet legal requirements:

```bash
# Allowed licenses (permissive, business-friendly)
license-checker --onlyAllow 'MIT;ISC;Apache-2.0;BSD-2-Clause;BSD-3-Clause'

# Production dependencies only (excludes dev tools)
--production --excludePrivatePackages
```

**Approved License Types:**
- **MIT**: Most permissive, minimal restrictions
- **ISC**: Similar to MIT, commonly used
- **Apache-2.0**: Patent protection, enterprise-friendly
- **BSD-2-Clause & BSD-3-Clause**: Permissive with attribution requirements

**Prohibited Licenses:**
- **GPL/AGPL**: Copyleft licenses requiring source disclosure
- **WTFPL/Unlicense**: Legally ambiguous or unclear terms

### 5. Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

The project generates comprehensive dependency inventories:

```bash
# Generate SBOM in CycloneDX format
pnpm run security:sbom

# Output: sbom.json - Complete dependency tree with versions, licenses, and metadata
```

**SBOM Benefits:**
- **Transparency**: Complete visibility into all dependencies
- **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for software composition
- **Incident Response**: Rapid identification of affected components during security events
- **Audit Trail**: Historical record of dependency changes

### 6. CI/CD Security Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow includes comprehensive supply chain validation:

```yaml
security-scan:
  steps:
    - name: Secret Detection Scan
      # Scans for hardcoded credentials and secrets

    - name: Dependency Vulnerability Scan
      # Identifies known vulnerabilities in dependencies

    - name: License Compliance Check
      # Validates all dependencies meet license requirements

    - name: Environment Configuration Security
      # Ensures secure environment variable handling
```

### 7. Supply Chain Attack Prevention

#### Dependency Confusion Protection
- **Scoped Packages**: Use `@organization/package-name` format when possible
- **Registry Configuration**: Explicit registry settings in .npmrc
- **Package Verification**: Automated checks for suspicious package names

#### Typosquatting Detection
```bash
# Check for potential typosquatting attempts
npx typosquot check package.json

# Validate package names against known patterns
npx package-name-validator $(jq -r '.dependencies | keys | .[]' package.json)
```

#### Maintainer Verification
```bash
# Analyze package maintainers for all dependencies
pnpm view $(jq -r '.dependencies | keys[]' package.json) maintainers

# Check package download patterns and popularity
pnpm view package-name downloads
```

## Security Configuration Files

### .npmrc Settings
```bash
# Security-focused npm configuration
audit-level=moderate                 # Fail on moderate+ vulnerabilities
verify-store-integrity=true          # Verify package checksums
engine-strict=true                   # Enforce Node.js version requirements
verify-signatures=true               # Verify package signatures when available
unsafe-perm=false                   # Disable unsafe operations
```

### .gitignore Security
```bash
# Prevent accidental secret commits
.env
.env.local
.env.production
.env.staging

# Exclude security-sensitive files
sbom.json                    # May contain sensitive dependency information
licenses-report.json         # License analysis output
risk-assessment.json         # Security risk assessment data
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Security Tasks

#### Weekly
- [ ] Run `pnpm run security:check` to validate current dependencies
- [ ] Review `pnpm outdated` for available security updates
- [ ] Check GitHub security advisories for used packages

#### Monthly
- [ ] Generate fresh SBOM with `pnpm run security:sbom`
- [ ] Review and update exact-pinned security dependencies
- [ ] Audit new dependencies added during the month

#### Quarterly
- [ ] Comprehensive security assessment of entire dependency tree
- [ ] Review and update license compliance requirements
- [ ] Update supply chain security tooling and configurations

### Incident Response

#### Vulnerability Discovery Process
1. **Immediate Assessment**: Run `pnpm audit` to identify affected packages
2. **Impact Analysis**: Review SBOM to understand scope of exposure
3. **Remediation Planning**: Use `pnpm audit --fix` for automatic fixes
4. **Manual Fixes**: Update exact-pinned dependencies as needed
5. **Verification**: Re-run security scans to confirm resolution

#### Emergency Updates
```bash
# Force update vulnerable package
pnpm update vulnerable-package --latest

# Update lockfile with security fixes
rm pnpm-lock.yaml && pnpm install

# Verify fix effectiveness
pnpm run security:check
```

## Best Practices Summary
