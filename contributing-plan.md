# Task Plan: Create CONTRIBUTING.md

## Task Classification
This is a **Simple** task that involves creating a single file with clear guidelines for contributions to the Leyline repository.

## Approach
1. Create a standard CONTRIBUTING.md file with:
   - Process for proposing new tenets and bindings
   - Guidelines for formatting and structure
   - Review requirements aligned with governance model
   - Instructions for local validation
   - PR submission process

2. The content will align with the governance section in PLAN.md, specifically:
   - Tenets require PR label "tenet" and 2 Core Maintainers approval
   - Bindings require PR label "binding" and 1 Core Maintainer approval
   - Patch (typo) releases auto-merge on green CI

3. Include instructions for running validation tools locally before submitting changes

## Implementation
Will create a clear, structured CONTRIBUTING.md file with appropriate sections and examples.
