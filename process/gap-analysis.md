# Gap Analysis: Source Philosophy to Tenets & Bindings

This document identifies gaps between the source philosophy documents and the current set of tenets and bindings in Leyline.

## Current Coverage

### Existing Tenets

1. simplicity
1. automation
1. testability
1. maintainability
1. modularity
1. explicit-over-implicit
1. document-decisions
1. no-secret-suppression

### Existing Bindings

1. ts-no-any (TypeScript)
1. go-error-wrapping (Go)
1. hex-domain-purity (All)
1. no-internal-mocking (All)
1. no-lint-suppression (All)
1. require-conventional-commits (All)
1. use-structured-logging (All/TypeScript/Go)

## Identified Gaps

### Core Principles

| Core Principle | Current Coverage | Gaps |
|----------------|------------------|------|
| Simplicity First | Tenet: simplicity<br>Bindings: ts-no-any, hex-domain-purity | Missing bindings for premature abstraction, YAGNI enforcement |
| Modularity is Mandatory | Tenet: modularity<br>Bindings: hex-domain-purity | Missing binding for package structure (organize by feature) |
| Design for Testability | Tenet: testability<br>Bindings: no-internal-mocking | Missing binding for dependency inversion |
| Maintainability Over Optimization | Tenet: maintainability<br>Bindings: None | Missing bindings for enforcing maintainability (code length, clarity) |
| Explicit is Better than Implicit | Tenet: explicit-over-implicit<br>Bindings: None | Missing bindings for explicit dependencies, no global state |
| Automate Everything | Tenet: automation<br>Bindings: require-conventional-commits | Missing bindings for CI pipeline requirements, pre-commit hooks |
| Document Decisions | Tenet: document-decisions<br>Bindings: None | Missing binding for architectural decision records |

### Architecture Guidelines

| Architecture Guideline | Current Coverage | Gaps |
|------------------------|------------------|------|
| Unix Philosophy | Covered by modularity tenet | Missing specific binding |
| Separation of Concerns | Binding: hex-domain-purity | Well covered |
| Dependency Inversion | No direct coverage | Missing binding for DIP |
| Package Structure | No direct coverage | Missing binding for feature-oriented structure |
| API Design | No direct coverage | Missing binding for API contracts |
| Configuration Management | Related to no-secret-suppression | Missing binding for configuration externalization |
| Error Handling | Binding: go-error-wrapping (partial) | Missing language-agnostic binding |
| Design for Observability | Binding: use-structured-logging (partial) | Missing bindings for metrics and tracing |

### Coding Standards

| Coding Standard | Current Coverage | Gaps |
|-----------------|------------------|------|
| Language Strictness | Binding: ts-no-any (partial) | Missing comprehensive strictness binding |
| Leverage Types | Binding: ts-no-any (partial) | Missing bindings for other languages |
| Default to Immutability | No direct coverage | Missing binding for immutable data structures |
| Pure Functions | Related to hex-domain-purity | Missing specific binding |
| Meaningful Naming | No direct coverage | Missing binding for naming conventions |
| No Suppressions | Binding: no-lint-suppression | Well covered |
| Dependency Management | No direct coverage | Missing binding for dependency governance |
| Length Guidelines | No direct coverage | Missing binding for code length limits |

## Priority Items for Creation

### High Priority Tenets

None - all fundamental tenets appear to be covered

### High Priority Bindings

1. **dependency-inversion** - Enforce Dependency Inversion Principle
1. **immutable-by-default** - Enforce immutable data structures
1. **feature-oriented-structure** - Package/module organization by business feature
1. **external-configuration** - No hardcoded configuration
1. **standardized-error-handling** - Consistent error handling patterns

### Medium Priority Bindings

1. **api-contracts** - Explicit API contract definition
1. **function-purity** - Pure functions for core logic
1. **meaningful-naming** - Naming convention enforcement
1. **code-size-limits** - Function and file length limits
1. **dependency-governance** - Dependency evaluation criteria

### Low Priority Bindings

1. **architectural-decision-records** - Document architectural decisions
1. **metrics-collection** - Standards for metrics collection
1. **distributed-tracing** - Standards for distributed tracing

## Next Steps

1. Create the high-priority bindings
1. Update existing bindings to enhance coverage
1. Schedule creation of medium and low priority bindings
1. Conduct periodic audits to ensure continued alignment
