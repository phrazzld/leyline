# Grug Binding Adoption Tracking

Framework for measuring the impact of grug wisdom integration, with focus on psychological safety improvements.

## Tracking Framework

### 1. Humble Confidence Metrics

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- Questions asked in code reviews (increase = good)
- "I don't know" statements in team discussions
- Junior developers participating in design discussions
- Simple solutions chosen over complex ones

**Measurement Methods:**
- Quarterly team surveys
- Code review analysis
- Retrospective themes

### 2. Complexity Reduction Metrics

**Code Metrics:**
- Average cyclomatic complexity trends
- Lines of code per feature
- Number of abstractions per module
- Configuration file sizes

**Before/After Comparisons:**
- Track projects before and after adopting grug principles
- Document specific refactorings inspired by complexity-detection-patterns
- Measure maintenance time for simplified vs complex code

### 3. Tool Mastery Progress

**Investment Tracking:**
- Hours spent learning vs switching tools
- Debugger usage vs print statements
- Advanced tool features adopted
- Knowledge sharing sessions conducted

**Success Stories:**
- Document specific debugging wins
- Track time saved through tool mastery
- Collect "aha moments" from learning

## Simple Tracking Template

```markdown
## Q[X] 2025 - Grug Adoption Report

### Humble Confidence
- Code review questions: [X]% increase/decrease
- Team psychological safety score: [X]/10
- Notable behavior changes: [examples]

### Complexity Battles
- Complexity demons slain: [list specific refactorings]
- YAGNI victories: [features successfully avoided]
- Saying no effectively: [pushback examples]

### Tool Mastery
- Debugger adoption: [X]% of team
- Print statement reduction: [X]%
- Tool learning hours: [X] hrs/person

### Success Stories
[2-3 specific examples of grug wisdom helping]

### Areas for Improvement
[What's not working, what needs adjustment]
```

## Data Collection Methods

### Automated Metrics
- Git history analysis for complexity trends
- Code coverage and test distribution
- Build time and bundle size trends

### Manual Collection
- Team survey (quarterly)
- Retrospective notes
- Success story submissions
- Code review sampling

## Baseline Establishment

Before tracking progress, establish baselines:

1. **Current State Survey**
   - How safe do developers feel asking questions?
   - How often do they use debuggers?
   - How complex is current code?

2. **Code Metrics Snapshot**
   - Average complexity scores
   - Test distribution (unit/integration/e2e)
   - Configuration complexity

3. **Tool Usage Audit**
   - Current debugging practices
   - Tool switching frequency
   - Knowledge depth assessment

## Simple Survey Questions

### Psychological Safety
1. "I feel comfortable saying 'I don't know' in team discussions" (1-5 scale)
2. "I ask questions when I don't understand code" (Never/Sometimes/Often/Always)
3. "I choose simple solutions without fear of judgment" (1-5 scale)

### Complexity Awareness
1. "I can identify complexity demons in code" (Yes/No/Learning)
2. "I've successfully pushed back on unnecessary features" (examples)
3. "I wait for patterns before abstracting" (Never/Sometimes/Often/Always)

### Tool Usage
1. "Primary debugging method" (Print/Debugger/Mix)
2. "Hours spent learning current tools this quarter" (number)
3. "Confidence with debugger features" (Basic/Intermediate/Advanced)

## Success Indicators

### Short Term (3 months)
- Increased question asking in reviews
- First complexity demon refactorings
- Basic debugger adoption

### Medium Term (6 months)
- Measurable complexity reduction
- Tool mastery improvements
- Team culture shifts visible

### Long Term (12 months)
- Sustained psychological safety
- Complexity prevention (not just removal)
- Deep tool expertise across team

## Case Study Template

Document specific adoption successes:

```markdown
### Case: [Team/Project Name]

**Challenge:** [What problem were they facing]

**Grug Principle Applied:** [Which binding/tenet helped]

**Actions Taken:** [Specific steps]

**Results:**
- Before: [metrics/situation]
- After: [improvements]

**Lessons Learned:** [What worked, what didn't]
```

## Keep It Simple

Remember: Don't let tracking become a complexity demon itself!
- Use existing tools where possible
- Automate only what's valuable
- Focus on trends, not precision
- Celebrate improvements, however small

The goal is to see if grug wisdom helps teams build better software with less stress, not to create a complex metrics system.
