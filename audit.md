# Audit: Source Philosophy Documents Coverage

This document presents a comprehensive audit of how well the rewritten tenets and bindings cover the principles, rules, and guidelines outlined in the source philosophy documents. The goal is to identify any gaps in coverage or clarity that may need to be addressed in future work.

## Methodology

This audit compares the rewritten tenets and bindings against the source philosophy documents using the following approach:

1. Identify core principles and guidelines from each source document
2. Map these to existing tenets and bindings
3. Assess the completeness and clarity of coverage
4. Identify any gaps or areas for improvement

The assessment uses the following criteria:
- **Complete**: Principle is fully covered in one or more tenets/bindings
- **Partial**: Principle is addressed but lacks depth or specificity
- **Missing**: Principle is not adequately addressed in any tenet/binding

## Gap Analysis

Based on the assessment above, the following gaps in coverage have been identified:

### Core Philosophy Gaps

1. **Package/Module Structure**: Only partially covered in modularity tenet, lacks specific guidance
2. **API Design**: Partially covered but lacks dedicated binding
3. **Pure Functions**: Partially covered but lacks dedicated binding
4. **Dependency Management**: Missing guidance on dependency minimization and updates
5. **Length Guidelines**: Missing guidance on function/file length
6. **Design for Observability**: Only logging aspect is covered, missing metrics and tracing

### Language-Specific Gaps

1. **Go-Specific Practices**: Missing bindings for:
   - Package design and naming conventions
   - Interface design
   - Concurrency patterns
   - Memory management

2. **TypeScript-Specific Practices**: Missing bindings for:
   - Module structure
   - Async/await patterns
   - React-specific patterns

3. **Rust-Specific Practices**: Missing bindings for:
   - Ownership and borrowing patterns
   - Error handling
   - Unsafe code guidelines
   - Trait design

4. **Frontend Practices**: No coverage for:
   - Component architecture
   - State management
   - Accessibility
   - Performance optimization

## Recommendations

Based on the identified gaps, the following new bindings are recommended:

### Core Recommendations

1. **Create API Design Binding**: Document best practices for designing clear, consistent APIs
2. **Create Pure Functions Binding**: Emphasize and formalize functional principles
3. **Create Dependency Management Binding**: Guidelines for minimizing and maintaining dependencies
4. **Create Code Size Binding**: Guidelines for maintaining appropriate function/file sizes
5. **Enhance Observability Binding**: Expand beyond logging to include metrics and tracing

### Language-Specific Recommendations

1. **Go-Specific Bindings**:
   - Go package design principles
   - Interface design in Go
   - Go concurrency patterns

2. **TypeScript-Specific Bindings**:
   - TypeScript module organization
   - Asynchronous patterns in TypeScript
   - React component design

3. **Rust-Specific Bindings**:
   - Rust ownership patterns
   - Rust error handling
   - Safe API design in Rust

4. **Frontend-Specific Bindings**:
   - Component architecture principles
   - State management patterns
   - Accessibility requirements
   - Frontend performance optimization

These recommendations provide a roadmap for future development to ensure comprehensive coverage of all important software development principles outlined in the source philosophy documents.
