# T022 Task Completion Summary

## Task: Fix missing lastModified dates in repository

### Work Completed
1. Identified all 27 binding files missing the lastModified field from the T020 validation report
2. Created a shell script (`fix-lastmodified.sh`) to automatically add the missing field
3. Used git history to determine appropriate dates (all files had last commit date of 2025-05-14)
4. Successfully added lastModified field to all 27 files:
   - 17 core binding files
   - 3 TypeScript binding files
   - 2 Rust binding files
   - 5 Go binding files
   - 2 Frontend binding files
5. Fixed duplicates in some files that were processed twice
6. Verified successful dry-run execution (exit code 0)

### Files Modified
All 27 binding files now have the required `lastModified: 2025-05-14` field added to their metadata section.

### Verification
- Dry-run completed successfully with exit code 0
- All files are now ready for actual migration

### Next Step
Task T023: Execute migration on repository (requires T022 completion)
