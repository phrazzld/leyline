# Create Ruby Development Bindings

## Overview
Create comprehensive Ruby development bindings derived from the expert council synthesis of modern Ruby best practices (2024-2025). These bindings will establish enforceable standards for Ruby development projects within the Leyline ecosystem.

## Context
A thinktank expert council session was conducted with 4 AI models (Gemini-2.5-Pro, Gemini-2.5-Flash, O3, O4-Mini) to synthesize the absolute best practices for modern Ruby programs. The resulting synthesis provides comprehensive, actionable guidance that should be formalized into Leyline bindings.

## Scope
Create bindings covering all major aspects of Ruby development:

### 1. Language & Syntax Bindings
- **Modern Ruby Features**: Pattern matching, endless methods, safe navigation
- **Performance-Conscious Coding**: Memory optimization, algorithmic efficiency
- **Concurrency Strategy**: Fiber Scheduler for I/O, Ractors for CPU-bound work
- **String & Object Management**: `frozen_string_literal: true`, efficient data structures

### 2. Architecture & Organization Bindings
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor injection, explicit dependencies
- **Service Objects Pattern**: Single-purpose objects with clear contracts
- **Project Structure**: Domain-based organization over technical layers
- **Boundary Management**: External adapters, clear interfaces

### 3. Testing Excellence Bindings
- **Testing Strategy**: 70/20/10 pyramid (unit/integration/system)
- **Dependency Mocking**: Mock external boundaries, not internal collaborators
- **Test Quality**: Fast execution, meaningful coverage, TDD workflow

### 4. Tooling & Environment Bindings
- **Code Quality Automation**: RuboCop configuration, custom cops
- **Development Environment**: Version management (asdf/rbenv), debugging setup
- **Build & CI Pipeline**: Automated quality gates, security scanning

### 5. Security & Production Readiness Bindings
- **Input Validation**: Schema-based validation at system boundaries
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Context-specific recommendations (JWT/Devise/Rodauth/Pundit)
- **Structured Logging**: JSON format, request IDs, observability integration
- **Error Handling**: Boundary-based exception management

### 6. Performance & Scalability Bindings
- **Database Performance**: N+1 prevention, query optimization, indexing strategy
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching (memory/request/cross-request)
- **Background Processing**: Idempotent job design, appropriate processors (Sidekiq/GoodJob)
- **Memory & GC Optimization**: Profiling, optimization techniques

### 7. Team Collaboration Bindings
- **Code Review Standards**: Behavior/architecture focus, automated style checks
- **Git Workflow**: Context-appropriate strategies (trunk-based/GitHub Flow)
- **Technical Debt Management**: Explicit tracking, prioritization, remediation
- **Documentation**: Living docs, architectural decisions, API documentation

## Application-Specific Binding Variants

### Web Applications (Rails)
- Authentication patterns (Devise vs Rodauth)
- Authorization with Pundit
- Caching strategies (Russian doll, fragment)
- Background job patterns

### APIs
- JWT authentication with rotation
- Serialization standards (JSON:API)
- Versioning strategies
- Documentation automation

### CLI Tools
- Command frameworks (Thor)
- Configuration management
- Distribution strategies
- Testing approaches

### Gems/Libraries
- Interface design (single entry point)
- Versioning (semantic)
- Multi-version testing
- Documentation (YARD)

## Implementation Requirements

### Binding Structure
Each binding should follow the established Leyline format:
- **YAML front-matter** with proper metadata
- **Derived from tenets** with explicit connections
- **Specific implementation guidance** with code examples
- **Contextual recommendations** for different scenarios
- **Validation criteria** for compliance checking

### Key Binding Categories Needed
1. `docs/bindings/categories/ruby/language-syntax.md`
2. `docs/bindings/categories/ruby/architecture-organization.md`
3. `docs/bindings/categories/ruby/testing-excellence.md`
4. `docs/bindings/categories/ruby/tooling-environment.md`
5. `docs/bindings/categories/ruby/security-production.md`
6. `docs/bindings/categories/ruby/performance-scalability.md`
7. `docs/bindings/categories/ruby/team-collaboration.md`

### Application-Specific Bindings
1. `docs/bindings/categories/ruby/web-applications.md`
2. `docs/bindings/categories/ruby/apis.md`
3. `docs/bindings/categories/ruby/cli-tools.md`
4. `docs/bindings/categories/ruby/gems-libraries.md`

## Expert Synthesis Integration

### Unique Insights to Preserve
- **Gemini-2.5-Pro**: Formal architectural patterns, dry-rb ecosystem, comprehensive testing
- **Gemini-2.5-Flash**: Modern language features, concurrency patterns, database optimization
- **O3**: Performance optimization, practical checklists, implementation roadmaps
- **O4-Mini**: Application-type differentiation, pragmatic tooling choices

### Resolved Contradictions
- **Version Management**: Contextual recommendations (asdf for polyglot, rbenv for Ruby-only)
- **Authentication**: Situation-based (Devise for existing, Rodauth for new projects)
- **Git Workflows**: Team-context appropriate (trunk-based for experienced, GitHub Flow for distributed)
- **Background Jobs**: Infrastructure-based (Sidekiq for Redis, GoodJob for PostgreSQL)

  - `thinktank-output/o4-mini.md`

### Related Tenets
- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, clear solutions over complex frameworks
- **Testability**: All code must be designed for straightforward testing
- **Explicit Over Implicit**: Make dependencies and contracts obvious
- **Fix Broken Windows**: Automate quality gates to prevent degradation
- **DRY**: Don't repeat yourself, but prioritize clarity over elimination of duplication

### Validation Integration
- Update `tools/validate_typescript_bindings.rb` to include Ruby binding validation
- Extend CI checks to validate Ruby binding compliance
- Create Ruby-specific binding templates

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All Ruby bindings created with proper YAML front-matter

- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new Ruby bindings

## Additional Context

This work directly supports the Leyline mission of sharing development principles through enforceable bindings. The expert synthesis represents collective intelligence from leading AI systems, providing a robust foundation for Ruby development standards.

The bindings should balance prescriptive guidance with contextual flexibility, acknowledging that different application types, team structures, and infrastructure choices require different approaches while maintaining core quality principles.
