# T064 Implementation Plan: Rewrite modularity tenet in natural language format

## Task Overview

Task T064 involves updating the modularity tenet to use the proper YAML front-matter
format and ensure it follows the natural language style guide.

## Analysis

After reviewing the current modularity.md file, I found:

1. The front-matter is using the older markdown heading format
   `## id: modularity last_modified: "2025-05-04"` instead of proper YAML format with
   triple dashes
1. The content of the tenet already follows natural language principles, with
   conversational tone, clear explanations, and proper structure

## Implementation Approach

1. Update the front-matter format to proper YAML:

   ```yaml
   ---
   id: modularity
   last_modified: "2025-05-08" # Today's date
   ---
   ```

1. Keep the existing content as it already follows natural language style:

   - It has a conversational tone addressing the reader directly
   - It explains the "why" before the "how"
   - It includes real-world analogies (LEGO bricks vs. stone sculpture)
   - It has detailed practical guidelines with clear explanations
   - It includes warning signs with bold patterns to watch for
   - It links to related tenets with explanations of relationships

## Validation

After making changes:

1. Run validation tools to ensure the document meets format requirements
1. Review the tenet against the natural language style guide checklist
1. Ensure the tenet appears correctly in the index

## Success Criteria

- Modularity tenet has proper YAML front-matter format
- Content follows natural language style guide
- Document passes all validation checks
- Tenet appears correctly in the automatically generated index
