# T031 Plan: Run Validation Tools on All Rewritten Bindings

## Task Analysis
- Execute the front-matter validation tool against all rewritten binding files (T021-T030)
- Identify and fix any validation errors
- Document the validation process and results

## Current State Assessment
- All bindings T021-T030 have been rewritten
- Need to ensure all binding files pass front-matter validation
- Need to identify any inconsistencies or errors that might have been introduced

## Implementation Steps
1. List all rewritten binding files (T021-T030)
2. Run the validation tool against each binding individually
3. Run the validation tool against all bindings at once
4. Document any validation errors encountered
5. Fix any validation errors found
6. Re-run validation to confirm all errors are resolved
7. Update TODO.md to mark task as complete
8. Commit changes

## Success Criteria
- All binding files pass front-matter validation
- Any identified errors are fixed
- Validation logs show successful validation for all binding files
- Changes are properly committed
